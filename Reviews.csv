Title_of_the_Review,Review_of_the_movie
SATISFIES THE HYPE!!!,"What an amazing movie by Marvel Studios! I was hyped for the movie since the first teaser and the movie actually exceedes my expectations. Marvel has been showing its MARVELous magic since Ironman, and Shang-Chi is another diamond in the crown. After the end of MCU's phase 3, fans were eagerly waiting for a big movie. Black Widow was not up to the mark and Eternals also disappointed majority of fans, but Chang-Chi filled their gap. The action scenes were fresh and engaging. Martial arts combined with chinese mythological powers makes these action scenes more interesting. Character arc and story building were satisfying. They were not rushed or slow paced. Whole movie was engaging till the end. I would love to see another movie of this franchise."
Surprisingly good,"I'll be honest - Marvel movies are not in my top 20 or even 50 but within the Marvel ""Universe"" I would say that Shang-Chi is in my top 5. I know, it's blasphemy and all that but think about it - is it better than Iron Man? I would admit yes - it's origin story is arguably better, and it's characters are a lot deeper. The Mandarin is a conflicted man, with evil but good as well, like real life. Is this movie better than The Avengers or Ragnarok or Infinity Wars? Hard to say, which means it's right up there with the best (of Marvel) in my opinion.

Plus, I'm a sucker for Chinese movies with the Chinese language being spoken - 1 of my favourite of all times, if not my absolute favourite, is of course 'Hero.' The Chinese language and the artistry of it's culture are magnificent.

All in all, well done Marvel, director Destin, and all those who worked to make this movie a reality. This is not just your average summer action movie; it's close to being a Masterpiece. And the humour is pretty swell too!

Cheers."
Fun and entertaining,Finally! A fun and entertaining movie without all the garbage Hollyweird offers. Great special effects and story line. Best movie I have seen since the Covid outbreak.
A new standard!,"The goal of an MCU solo film is to sell the audience on a new character and power system. This movie does both perfectly, within the first 30 minutes we are drawn to Shang as a character and that lasts throughout the entire movie. The fight scenes have love and care poured into them and I hope they bring this team back for future MCU movies involving Shang because they pay homage to old kung fu movies beautifully."
Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,"6/10 - I seem to be the only one to not be marveling at the latest Marvel Studios offering, but while this movie is technically sound (visual effects, stunt work, sound, cinematography, you name it), I found it to be mostly a rehash of things I've seen before (maybe I'm just getting tired of all these superhero movies)"
Mixed - Snoozing Start/Needs focus and Better Writing,
So good!!,"The best marvel movie after Endgame. The story is a bit cliché but the rest is absolutely amazing. The fight scenes are the best in the MCU in my opinion. Simu Liu as Shang-Chi is perfectly chosen and all the other characters are nice and the all the actors do a good job. Act 3 is on another level that we haven't seen before in MCU and the visual effects are spectacular, by far one of the best origin stories from Marvel!"
Sort of disappointed..,"I got to admit I wasn't particularly blown away by anything in the movie.. I might even say ""I was bored"" by it.

Don't get me wrong.. it IS a spectacle! The action is great. The locations are nice, costume design, sound design, etc. But it is overall a soft release not worth seeing in theaters.. specially as a follow-up to what Endgame was.

The biggest problem for me, is how the underwritten lead has muddled personality (for reasons covered in the story) devoid of charm, personality or good dialogue.

The next issue is the humor, which didn't land for me.. Not once. The supporting lead Awkwafina isn't her normal ""loud"" self that's supposed to be funny every time she opens her mouth. Her role is very supportive and a little dramatic. And while I questioned myself why was she even there for, it doesn't ultimately matter. She is another forgettable character that is given more importance than the role deserves.

Finally, the third act is weak. There's a balancing problem with stakes. You can't feel tension or weight to any action. And there's a lot of superficial ""I can't do it"" until they can.

In the end, this feels like a very safe plot, written in a way to appeal to china (considering how the Mandarin is portrayed), that ends up appealing to no one specific. Certainly doesn't feel like a Marvel movie.. but it was bound to happen if we are to be introduced to different aspects of the narrative. But it also doesn't feel like a comic book. It's more generic than that."
Great movie,I thought it was a great hero movie. It developed the character as well as others and felt like the story was complete. This story was over and now it's time for the next.
Amazing,"Best movie of the year. I waited for that kind of movie the whole year. It has comedy, fantasy, action, it keeps you on your toes, ... just great. Can't wait for part two."
Amazing movie!,"Truly an amazing movie! This movie depicts family very well. The visual effects are stunning, the martial arts are incredible, and there is just enough humor in it to relieve some of the darker notes. I can't wait for the sequel!"
Questionable script (and Awkwafina is just the worst),"The characters are a bit incoherent and straight up contradict their own characterizations at times, because the plot needs them to do it. There are a bunch of unneeded ""deux-ex machina"" or conveniences because the writers trapped themselves into corners for no reason (that's what happens when you get the 2021 ""Mortal Kombat"", ""WW84"" and ""The Expendables"" writers).

Also, we have Awkwafina destroying every type of scene (dramatic; epic; and also the comedic ones) with one of the worst ""acting"" I've ever seen and a same type of joke (""awkward nonsense"") over and over, from start to finish, with a role ridiculously large for a dumb comic relief.

But... Liu is actually pretty good as a lead (and his character is potentially great), and the ""Shang-Chi world"" is beautiful and it has everything to be super fun to watch in the future...without Awkwafine and better writers."
"beautiful science fiction, fantasy and action movie!","Everything comes in it beautiful science fiction and beautiful mythical creatures. Sometimes you have creatures that don't seem real, but these just seemed real. Well done! There was a bit of avatar feeling in it. Fighting for the safekeeping of peace. Really beautiful. And self-acceptance was also nicely incorporated."
Loved it,This was fantastic. Saw it in theaters then again as soon as it was out on streaming too! The story and characters were great to explore; the action sequences and special effects keep you immersed; and the actors all made the story come to life.
"Fresh Story, Great action scenes","I love all the movies from them but Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings is one of my favorite marvel movies, it really managed to make a very nice movie, the story is usually a gorgeous one, the characters are very nice and you become very invested in the movie.

I was amazed at what good fight sequences are in the movie like this, the best since The Avengers 2012 and Captain America: The Winter Soldier 2014 maybe even better.

The CGI is incredible, I only saw such special effects on Avatar.

I have to say that I ran and saw the fight on the bus 5 times, it's awesome ... it manages to give you an energy boost, so cool The story is extraordinary, Shang-Chi confronts the past he thought he left behind, when his father wants to reunite his lost family.

Xu Wenwu played by Tony Leung is such a good villain, you understand why he does this, you empathize with him and although you know that the way he acts is wrong you understand his pain. Besides being a villain he is also my father and everything he wants to release his wife.

A very good villain, certainly one of the best villains of this year.

This movie blow me away, I love it. Lots of love from Bangladesh 🇧🇩"
Waaaaw!,"An amazing movie (Original, great cast, nice soundtrack, CGI is just pure eye candy, good comical releaf as usual) and great addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe!!! Can't wait for what's to come!"
Simu Liu Brought It,"Really entertaining movie. Actors were great Simu Liu brought it big time he is excellent as the main character. Awkwafina is hilarious and I wish she had more screen time. As far as Marvel movies goes, it's not the best one but still very good."
Good action movie with all the MCU flavours,"Movie has a lot of stuff to keep you hooked.

1. VFX. Whole movie is visually stunning 2. Stunt choreography is awesome. Probably the best in MCU so far imo.

3. Background score. I felt goosebumps everytime the main theme kicks in. Soundtrack is good too.

4. Decent acting except the one who played Shang chi's father who had a menacing screen presence

Despite of the perfectly blended Chinese culture and the MCU's successful (so far) action formula, this movie isn't free from cliche moments. I just wished the second half was less predictable and had something more to offer."
This like anime but love action which is great,This film is a love letter to Asia. The creatures the atmosphere the fights. They really took their time with this. Many people complain about final fight but if you watch anime or know of anime you should know better.
Loved it,Asian representation without compromising on storytelling. Great cinematics and CGI. Can't wait to see what the Marvel team delivers next. Perfectly executed!
Better than expected!,
Brilliant,I absolutely loved this film. It's packed with action and really good martial arts. The film is really funny. It's got a great story line. The acting is fab.
Kickass movie,"Entertaining movie ..worth it ..the bus scene ..oh boy ..on loop ..overall visual treat , neat cgi and enjoyable marvel movie ..you will love it ..don't miss it."
AWESOME MOVIE!!,The movie was awesome.much better then i expected............action was awesome and the plot was awesome too......acting was quite good.highly recomend seeing this.
Great Origin,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021)

Well what a pleasant surprise, very much in the style of Black Panther, this origin story was really great from start to finish.

I saw this at the 3D 4DX at the O2 and we were thrown about, blown on, rained on and every other sensation at every turn it was fab-u-lus!

We had some great acting some great humour and plenty of ""magic"", for Marvel fans after the lacklustre Black Widow, the disaster of the Winter Soldier. Two goodens in a row what with Snake Eyes!

The fight scenes we well worked through and the opening bus sequence was very memorable. I don't thing there was anything I didn't like about this movie so I'm giving 10 outta 1."
LIVELY!,"Watched the IMAX version! Best solo since Iron Man (2008)! I had no expectations of this before. But the movie is much more lively. Enjoyed every moment. And also very engaging from start to finish. A kinda Cute-Action movie with some fun stuff!

This is the first movie that focuses more on martial arts than Marvel's superpower thing. Love to see a mix of Marvel's MASTER-LEVEL-CGI with Martial art. Kung-Fu with this kind of visual effect! Marvel nailed it again.

I've always loved Marvel's casting. Katy is too perfect for her role. Loved her chemistry with Shaun. Also laughed out loud at her childish stuffs.

Just one thing, not a big deal, the action scene of 'Dragon Riding' doesn't fit into the usual Marvel movie. But as Chinese flavor, it is OK. Except for this, the cinematography and VFX are a lot mesmerizing!"
Who knew a superhero film could be so beautiful?,"I'll start by saying that if you're looking for a great story, you'll be disappointed. Shang-Chi is a pretty standard hero's journey at its core, which is a shame because the story could have been inspired by House of Flying Daggers and other wuxia titles.

So why a rating so high? Because where the story falls, everything else excels.

Shang-Chi is visually spectacular and a real treat for the eyes with some visuals that are incredibly distinct for the MCU. In regards to aesthetics, Black Panther walked so Shang-Chi could run a marathon.

The fight scenes are all amazing. There's one weak fight, but it's meant to be weak, and they're all very long, which is great to see. One of the early ones went on for a solid 5 - 10 minutes, which was unexpected but far from disappointing.

The first actual fight scene is my favourite in the MCU, and I was worried none of the others would top it, but they were all delightful to watch, and I was so glad they did a parallel of it later on. Either way, the writers went hard on the fight scenes and that paid off.

In summary, the story is lacking, but I'm glad in a way because that allowed everything else to shine. And shine, it did. I hope future directors take lessons from the aesthetics and choreography of Shang-Chi."
Not too bad...,"Overall this movie exceeded my expectations. I wish I had gone to see it in theatres because visually, this movie is stunning. All the fight scenes, especially the ending would have looked even cooler on the big screen.

But stepping back and thinking about the actual story, it's kind of random, predictable at times and I'm not seeing how they're going to incorporate it into the rest of the MCU.

The other thing is the fight scenes: the choreography, the cinematography, the effects, they were great, and I think they knew that, so they took advantage of it. During the first half of the movie there would be a new fight scene every fifteen minutes that looked fantastic, but seemed to last just a bit too long.

All in all I liked it. The acting was pretty good, the pacing was reasonable, the soundtrack was unique and the visual effects were a strongpoint It was a good movie."
Screen play 😲😲,
Could've been great,"Shang-Chi is a boring film. The characters were okay, but the story was choppy and confusing. The song choices were odd. Plus, this movie was way too long. And the scene at the end had me practically falling asleep."
Entertaining action movie with great special effects.,
ALMOST a Superhero-Masterpiece,
A Ringer for a Great MCU Flick,
It was okay...,"I really liked that the actors spoke their native language, Mandarin, because it would've felt too Americanized otherwise. But there was something unfinished about this movie and I'm not sure what it is. The pacing was alright, a little too slow or fast at times, and as far as storylines go, it was not as exciting as I thought it would be. The fight scenes were great though, especially the final grand battle scene."
This could've been great if it wasn't for the cheesy writing.,"The story was riddled with holes and plot issues. Since when does Awkwafina's pedestrian character all of a sudden get invited to become part of the MCU team? What's her super power... stupidity? Don't get me wrong, I love her, but her character was lazily written. Then there's the whole daddy issues dynamic - Shang is with him, then against, then with etc.. Then we have these ridiculous dragons fighting, where one scores some power crystals and becomes stronger! This is just infantile lazy writing. There was zero shock value or anything spectacular in the entire runtime, with tedious long middle acts and a bumbling third act. The jokes were cliched and not funny. The funniest parts were Ben Kingsley's character, (of whom was in this for what reasons??) and the ending to go Karaoke - which was the only time I actually cracked a chuckle. You'd think with three writers we'd have something cohesive and coherent. But instead of a Marvel superhero story, we got a Disney evil vs good with dragons thrown into the mix. It's as if they tried too hard to create the Asian version of Black Panther.

It's a shame, because the directing and cinematography were spot on, and great S/VFX - although a little overboard with the CGI i.e. Dragons. The martial arts choreography was outstanding (although again, overboard after the awesome bus scene), and the casting and performances were excellent, especially Leung, who pretty much carried the film on his shoulders. It's a 7/10 from me."
Great magical action film.,"Spiritual magic, martial arts, fighting, comedy. It has a bit of everything for everyone. I highly recommend this film. Marvel superheroes at their very best. If you watch films like this for escapism you won't be disappointed."
You can't miss this,
Mediocre film from Marvel,"Let's agree that it is a bad movie from multiple points of view. It depends a lot on the visual effects, its main characters can be funny but not nice, the story does not generate much interest and we have seen the fights many times and in a better way in almost any film produced in Hong Kong, Indonesia or Thailand of the last twenty years. The only thing that saves this film is the karaoke scene that is unexpectedly welcome. The rest is routine, mediocre, tiring and bland."
Director and Actors were spot on,
Amazing,"I am so happy that I watched this in the cinema! I found it really funny, perfect balance of serious and amusing. The Mandarin speaking makes the film feel so much more authentic. The amount of films I have watched that are set in another country but start speaking English, it makes them feel unrealistic. Again, this film is amazing and is worth your time."
Aesthetic,
Actually Really Enjoyed It!,"Whoa! I watched Shang-Chi because I wanted to put something on in the background and I just ended up getting invested!

I would go to say this is one of the best singular films in the MCU. I found films such as Thor and Black Panther slightly boring. They are full of information but I just couldn't get invested as much as I wanted too. I'd slightly fallen out of my obsession with the MCU over the past couple of years, but Shang-Chi could help bring my obsession back.

It's about so many things at once, but the main plot is basically about Shang-Chi trying to find family with his friend Katie. That's the best way to describe it without minor spoilers. I believe this film really represented the culture well, and the scenery really helped to intrigue me to keep watching longer. The characters are all pretty likeable too and the fight scenes were amazing!

A criticism I would have, which I have with many Marvel films, is that I feel like some scenes dragged on a little too long, but that's me really picking in details. I also found it hard to follow the plot at one point, but I soon picked back up what was happening.

I really recommend this, even if you're not a fan of the MCU. I'd say it's one of Marvels strongest movies that has released recently! Really looking forward to where Marvel takes this series next."
Quality marvel movie,
A perfect movie,I think Shanchi was perfect for the film and he deserves a great score. I saw the film and it was wonderful. I suggest you to see that there are excellent and perfect actors in the film.
More of this Disney!,"Cretton is an amazing director, and he like totally proves it here once again. I love the way he tells stories, and Shang-Chi is finally not just like every other mindless Disney film of their new big franchises. The action is worth it compared to other Marvel films, and the acting is to be expected as great considering at least Disney knows how to hire actors, albeit they don't let people often tell real stories. Go watch this! Somewhere! Anywhere! Everywhere!"
Loved this movie,"I am not a comic book reader and I knew nothing about any of the marvel characters but I have enjoyed the movies so far. And this movie is no exception! It was greatly entertaining, I liked the characters even though I knew nothing about them coming into the movie. It was funny, and cool action scenes and overall, just a good movie!"
Best Marvel Movie,"Hands down the best Marvel movie they've made. This movie was perfect in every way. Flow, casting, comedy, action, drama, CGI, story... literally everything was perfect.

The amount of emotional investment in the characters was was deep! It was just the best movie I've seen in such a long time!"
Amazing!,"MCU aside, this movie stands alone as an epic masterpiece on its own! The fight scenes were visually stunning, great acting, great story highly reccomend!"
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Superhero.","Martial arts meets the MCU in Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings. More Crouching Tiger than Jackie Chan, the plot for the film is kinda hum-drum, the sort of mystical Eastern fantasy cobblers that practically writes itself.

Shang-Chi is the son of immortal, power-hungry warlord Xu Wenwu (Tony Chiu-Wai Leung) and Li (Fala Chen), a warrior woman from the hidden village of Ta Lo. After falling in love with Li and becoming a father, Wenwu gives up his wicked ways and packs away the ten legendary rings that gave him much of his power. However, after his wife is killed by his old enemies, Wenwu once again wears the rings and trains his son to become an assassin. Ashamed of what he has become, Shang-Chi goes into hiding in America and becomes Shaun (Simu Liu), but his past eventually catches up with him when his father sends his army, The Ten Rings, to steal the pendants given to him and his sister Xialing (Meng'er Zhang) by their mother. Wenwu requires both pendants to reveal the way to Ta Lo, where he believes that his wife is being held captive by her people.

This Marvel movie is at its most fun before the plot starts to get in the way and the CGI becomes too overbearing and intrusive: the early fight scenes - a battle on a runaway bus against a henchman known as Razor Fist, and a fight on some high-rise bamboo scaffolding - deliver lots of impressively choreographed action that will please both martial arts fans and superhero addicts. Awkwafina, as Shang-Chi's loyal friend Katy, provides some comic relief, but also gets stuck in with the action.

Unfortunately, the film quickly goes downhill after the good guys make their way to Ta Lo, with a little help from Tony Slattery (see Iron Man 3) and a furry winged creature with no face. The inevitable battle between the villagers and Wenwu's army is typical overblown Marvel mayhem, but the massive CGI tsunami arrives when Wenwu opens the inter-dimensional gate that he thinks is holding Li prisoner: instead of releasing his wife, he frees a swarm of flying tentacled soul-suckers and their big bad boss The Dweller. Fortunately for the Ta Lo people, they have a massive magical dragon on their side, which wakes up and adds to the digital whizz-bangery.

As technically impressive as the special effects are, I found the second half of the film visually overwhelming yet remarkably uninvolving - a whirlwind of pixels and noisy action without much substance.

5/10. It was nice to see HK/Chinese stars Michelle Yeoh, Tony Leung and Yuen Wah together in a Marvel movie; I just wish it had been a better one."
Amazing story,"A very extraordinary story in a film production.

Just an input, I think it would be very extraordinary if every country in the world opened several places to be used as places for promotion of new production, of course also with the language of that country. This is an example of a good film production but not a few do not know that this is a good film."
Well done Shang Chi,
Another great Marvel Movie,"I loved the cast, music, plot, everything. I especially loved Xialing because she was so powerful. Morris was also so so adorable. I really enjoyed all the action, as well as some comedic scenes and I'm so ready for the next Shang-Chi movie!"
A lot like Chinese Xianxia novels but theres no you're courting death,"This is a really good uptake on a marvel movie. Its definitely not like other movies in the MCU, the different cultural aspect makes it a fresh approach and the action scenes are stunning. The story is marvelously portrayed, its a simple story but the direction is amazing and the screenwriting and the vfx team. They did a great job. I loved this movie."
Shang Empty,"Sorry for the delay.

Here we go...

I'm not feeling this movie. It starts with promise but It lost me after Wong vs Abomb.

The fighting is exciting. The movie lacks excitement though. It's a plain dull movie.

It's about a Karate master and... yeah the movie lost me and I have know idea what it's about. This is the first mcu film that I lost interest for midway. Even Im3 wasn't so bad because I lost interest from the very beginning.

Gotg2, mcu Spiderman 1/2 and IM3 are still the worse in mcu. Shang Chi just joined the club.

A movie so full of emptiness that it makes an empty box jealous

I'm not sure how this is a 7. Fans and the average movie goer should also be held responsible for horrible movies.

This movie ain't a 7 even if you watched this movie as blind and drunk.

They tried to be funny by having Wong be rude by drinking the couple's drink at the end credit scene. That wasn't funny at all. Wizard or not.

Speaking of funny, I didn't laugh once. When I used to watch these movies in theatres, the audience often told me when I should have laughed. I watched it at home, therefore I didn't know my cue of when to laugh.

The mcu needs to chill with the daddy issue plot

THOR Loki daddy issue Black Panta daddy issues Stark Daddy issues Star lord Daddy issues Ultron daddy issues Nebula and Gamora daddy issues Shang daddy issue Wasp daddy issues Scott langs daughter Daddy issues

No one has mommy issues.

Don't watch this movie."
Dumb and Stupid....,"It had potential but marvel has this tendency of degrading everything into mindless comedy...

Things just happen, to an extent where Awkwafina is now an avenger... I'm getting too old for this s#.t.."
Fighting scenes were really good,"Obviously this film is heavily Americanized, but the martial arts were so beautiful and well done! I haven't seen fighting scenes like that for a hot minute and it brings me back to my childhood, like watching Jet Lee, Michelle Yeoh, and Jackie Chan. I really wish they spoke more mandarin in specific scenes though. The English made scenes weak to me personally, idk being threatened in English didn't cut it, but when the villain threat the elder in mandarin, that hit different.

Overall, I loved the movie and am so proud that an Asian protagonist is in the MCU. I understand they want the movie to appeal to Americans, but I'd wish they keep the movie a bit more Asian traditional than super Americanized lol."
Disappointment,"People voted 8-10, rly? For what? Story line is primitive and the gaps filled with some martial arts. ""and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" there was no any legend at all, just rings which give some super powers we see them in the begging of the movie and at the end. Producers added Ben Kingsley and Benedict Wong to tailor Shang-Chi to other MCU movies, but it feels so disconnected like Billy Bob Thornton as a Santa in Bad Santa. Michelle Yeoh is playing Crouching Tiger again, it's so SAD that Hollywood does not give her non-kung-fu roles, she has talent for sure.

In short, after 1hr I started to check my watch because the whole thing was so boring I just wanted it to end."
"Good choreography, disappointing story",
Better than expected,
"Pretty great action, overall fun film to watch","Shang-Shi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is definitely pretty high up on my MCU list, a lot because of it's really well directed action sequences. In a lot of previous MCU fight scenes it can be kind of hard to even tell what is going on half the time. But in Shang-Shi, not only are some of the fight scenes really interesting like that one scene on the bus where we get that continuous shot of Shang-Shi moving up the bus through a bunch of people, or the scene where they're attacked on the side of the building and half to climb down this thing, jumping and swinging around it. Also, the movie looks AWESOME at some times, and it's kinda' like a light show. The special effects look great, and the movie is well directed, and fun to watch.

Really the only problem I have with movie are just smaller, like the movie kinda' slows down toward the middle. There's also that scene toward the end of the movie, where we see him flashing back to his mom getting taken away, which seems kinda' useless and just to dramatize everything before we reach the big climax.

But other than that, the movie is totally worth the watch and I highly recommend it."
Not a fan of Marvel movies but enjoyed this,"This film felt refreshing and didn't feel too much like a marvel movie. Felt like I was just watching a mythological modern film.

I had a good time watching it. Only downside was some of the CGI felt very rushed at some points. But Iwas willing to overlook it as I think it is worth the watch."
Marks a bland start to the new phase of Marvel Cinematic Universe,"Destin Daniel Cretton's 'Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings' marks a bland start to the new phase of Marvel Cinematic Universe. It is a spectacle with regards to action sequence and fighting choreography, but the film misses a solid storyline for an origin story as its titular character lacks personality and does not go through any heroic transformation story arc. Simu Liu has a strong presence as Shang-Chi, yet he is overshadowed by many of his more experienced co-stars."
something unique and fresh,"After 10 years of almost every movie being.armed combat, this one is fresh and the perfect start for phase 4 (yes, the start is with black widow but is something ""old"", too related to the previous phases), i loved every single moment, i got chills, i laughed. The soundtrack is astonishing, as the.cinematography. The best of the mcu if i may. Loved the colors. The fighting sequence leave you attached to the screen as they seem like they are dancing. All combined is something else, completely new and i can't wait to see more of simu liu as shang-chi because he was.brilliant.

Go see the movie!!"
Brudy gud frilm,So much better than a lot of other Avengers spin offs. Entertainment without limits. Apart from some technical goofs a great mix of magic and action. Nice to see ordinary looking actors getting main parts.
Wow!,"From Beginning to End I enjoyed this movie. It is well done, The characters are well written and honestly, I would love to see more Shang Chi and other characters in future marvel Movies and TV Shows. I love how Phase 4 is going so far, I can not wait to see more of the Expanding Marvel Cinematic Universe in Movies and TV Shows. Overall, Fantastic Film!"
Get some,"If you only ever watched one movie at the cinema in your entire span of days, make it this phenomenal sight, sound and super spectacular sensory sensation. Smashes everything out of the park! And some."
Unpredictable,"Film is great overall and in this genre at least, is one of the best all year round that has been generally lacklustre. Definitely a good movie to watch as it does what it is supposed to in that it is generally a setup film for something bigger in the MCU."
Must watch a second time,"After watching this movie in the theater, I thought, ""Wow, that was not what I expected, it was more visually appealing than I thought it would be"". At 2nd watch, I really was impressed how rock solid the story was. I loved the way they Humanized Xu Wenwu and made this a tragic love story. The acting was amazing when it came from the amazing actors (obviously). Tony Leung, Ben Kingsley and Michelle Yeoh are legends and acted accordingly. Simu Liu will rightfully be a superstar because of his performance. I want to see more of Meng'er Zhang, I think that she has huge potential. My only disappointment was how quickly Death Dealer died. Andy Le is an awesome performer.

Combining everything, this may be my favorite Marvel Movie of all time... and I didn't even Mention Morris!"
Highly recommended!,"Fun, solid blockbuster elevated by its sensitive treatment of culture and the migrant experience. The fight choreography was excellent, best I've seen in a while - dynamic, engaging, fresh. The soundtrack was also incredible.

The film takes care to depict the lives of millenial Asian migrants, including all the karaoke (!) (Source: I am an Asian millennial migrant)

Strongest point of the movie is the always-superb Tony Leung, who really brings the character of Wenwu to life. One of the best - honestly, the best, Marvel villain to date. My only wish was that Michelle Yeoh had a bit more to do on screen."
Good but seems familiar,
ignore the bad reviews!!,"Now one of my marvel favs (as a fan since the beginning!)- this movie is so beautifully written, the storyline is original and creative, and the acting is impeccable. Another phase 4 hit!!!"
Beautiful MCU movie with crazy action scenes.,"Shang-Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings is the 25th MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) movie which also has the 1st major Asian representation in the MCU.

I loved the film because it had an amazing story filled with a lot of elegant, eye-pleasing scenes and super awesome crazy action scenes such as the bus fight. The movie also includes amazing martial art techniques and beautiful Chinese things too.

This film doesn't have recognizable adult stuff and very violent action scenes as many of the previous MCU productions had, which makes the film, ""Shang-Chi"" suitable even for younger kids like age 10. I didn't even feel the time passing by when I was watching this film because the story had an amazing flow with the stuff I mentioned before. I can't say anything else about the movie as I might include spoilers.

Shang-Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings is an amazing, beautiful, action packed movie for the start of major Asian representations in the MCU."
One of the best marvel movie,"When a Marvel movie released audience has a certain expectation how it should be. And this movie exceeds the expectations for a Marvel movie with a great story and great cast. Casting, directing and specially the art direction of the movie had a certain quality which usually could not see in most of the movies in recent past.

Overall the mystical theme of the movie added a special feel to Marvel movies."
Great fight scenes...,"....and that's at least the minimum you'd want from this type of action film. And that bus scene, whhooo! I also loved the mixture of languages in some scenes (I don't have a problem with subtitles). All of the leads are well cast, as are several supporting characters, and the script is pretty tight."
Good action flick with just enough comedy,"The Action scenes were on par with the crouching tiger hidden dragon and other awesome awesome Kung Fu movies that that came before. There was bruce Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan is Jackie Chan elements to elements to the fight scenes.

The comedy was not over the top or too much or forced into areas to break up the heavy drama. Like the Cape in Dr. Strange whipping away the tear.

Hoodnmobie, better than I expected."
Shang Chi review,"This film us well written and directed. All the action sequences are well choreographed. This is an origin story but it will not give you marvel movie vibe(in a positive way) until and unless you will see the post credit scenes. Yes, there are 2 credit scenes. Simu liu and Tony was the highlight of the movie, Awkwafina has also performed well. Her chemistry with Simu was extraordinary and her comic timing was also perfect."
"It's very pretty, but the story/plot is mediocre and filled with holes","As far as visuals go, this movie is amazing... like just about as impressive as Dune, it's filled to the brim with eye-candy.

The plot/story however is mediocre and filled with plot holes... the characters' actions are often unrealistic and they will often just 'stare in awe' at their friends being killed, instead of doing the realistic thing, and immediately defending their friends... it's something that happens like 5 times and honestly spoils the movie for me.... if characters in a movie don't act or react realistically and stare at something like a braindead zombie (like their friends getting killed right in front of them, whilst they are holding a gun in their freeking hands), then it's just really terrible script/plot writing.

Overall, the movie isn't as bad as Ant-Man 2 but it's not far behind. Also, Awkwafina's acting style was already old by the 2nd movie she did... ALL of her characters in movies are the same person, and like I said, it got boring after the 2nd movie. I roll my eyes at everything Awkwafina's character does in the movie.

It's a 5/10 movie, not really worth a watch unless you're a real die-hard Marvel fan."
Marvel's pandemic marvel,"I'm a big time marvel fan and would have anyway rated the movie good. But I genuinely loved the movie and instantly rewatched which I rarely do given the plethora of content available these days.

I would even rate the movie better then endgame. It has more action and less talking."
Well acted by Tony Leung,"Appreciate the character played by Tony Leung Chiu-Wai of Xu Wenwu. His acting, charm and charisma was so brilliant that even though he was the villain. He empowered it with his acting skills.

The movie has exceptional choreographed action choreography that we have not witnessed since Captain America: Winter Soldier. Great sequences of martial craftsmanship."
Great new entry to the MCM,"A tad too heavy on the CGI and a bit too much wire work, making it more like ""crouching tiger"" in some of the fight scenes, but definitely one I'll enjoy re-watching."
Stunning,"This movie was stunning. From the visual effects to the heart of the story to the phenomenal cast. I laughed, I cried and sat on the edge of my seat. Well worth taking the risk during the pandemic to go see this one in the theater. The music was great as well. Will definitely buy it when it comes out for rewatch. One of the best Marvel movies IMO."
So ends the Marvel Universe,To see Sir Ben Kingsley reprise his role as comedy relief for a movie that already has us suffering through another Awkafina performance is sad and redundant. This is what happens when Disney and Marvel try too hard to find a path forward after Endgame. The Asian theme is new but the vague attempts to tie the movie to the MCU smack of desperation. This is just not a good movie. A lot of expensive visuals but that does not make a movie good. Lots of narrative and exposition to explain the visuals but that does not make the movie good or interesting. I understand that it is show business and this movie was made to make money but if I hadn't been lucky enough to watch it on Disney+ I would feel cheated.
This is highly overrated,"Boring and poor storyline.why there have to be a dragon if it's a Asian origin movie, this is such a stereotype. This is marvel's sad attempt to cover all the Asian market. Avoid this."
One of the best marvel movies yet!,"I was blown away with this movie! It reminds you of an old jackie chan movie yet still being modern enough to bring in a new audience. The acting is great, the special effects are amazing and the fight scenes.... OMG they are the best fight scenes I have ever scene in a movie!! And the soundtrack to go along with it is just perfect.

All and all this is a great addition to the mcu and I'm excited to see where they go with Shang-Chi next in the mcu."
Shang-chi,"I loved the movie , it is awesome , in fact i've never seen this type of amazing marvel movie...the story line , the graphics , the vfx , the visuals are just fantaboulous ...I strongly suggest you to whatch this piece of art. Loved the acting of the actors , I really loved the way they mixed american and Chinese culture with Chinese language used here and there ... Great movie."
Tony Leung Brilliant performance made the show more than incredible.,"The cgi are rather mudane but Tony Leung Performance was simply brilliant.

Its like his eye can transmit the sorrow Simply brilliant. I think an award should be apt.

The henchmen were rather underwhelming as well but all is saved by Tony's performance Wish there can be more story on the dragon and the evil dragon."
Awesome,Great effects. I have waited for the movie to arrive on Disney plus and I honestly am upset I haven't watched sooner! Great movie. The cast made the movie very fun and I enjoyed the Creatures and dragon!
"Soulless movie, even a soul sucking monster couldn't give this a soul",This is the worst marvel movie I have seen to date.after seeing the movie I was honestly surprised by all the high ratings. Did we watch the same thing? The movie is without a soul. Characters aren't build up enough even with a 2 hour run time. The movie literally got nothing to do with the ten rings. Movie became Godzilla vs King Kong at the end. Waste of 2 hours. Honestly clueless why people high praised for this movie. What a waste of opportunity to create a wonderful and authentic world for Asian marvel universe.
HORRIBLE,"This was so bad , I'm honestly shocked on how lazy the writing is I really am. This was probably the worst movie I've seen in a long time wow. No hate on the actors or even some fight scenes but this was sooooooooo bad."
KATY,"So, the fighting scenes were good, cgi not bad, chemistry in the movie between the cast were near absent, woowoo had an arc just for the big final fight to happen but whatever,

Movie is a 7 at best, but i removed 2 stars because,

KATY

what in the ass donkey is this character, so annoying, every scene she is in just drains your brain.

Even the voice, like woman, clear your throat or stop smoking or something ffs, feels like it was the only other asian chick available in wokewood."
Good action movie but don't think of it as marvel.,
Pretty solid,I had no preconceived ideas of what this movie would be but I was very surprised and delighted. It's probably one of the better standalone movies from the Marvel verse. I definitely enjoyed it more than Ant Man.
This movie surprised me,"Have not been a huge fan of the Disney/Marvel universe films as of late. But, this one was a shock to me.

This film was very well done. It was great because they had a very ""Jackie chan"" feel to the movie with the rhythm and pace of the fight scenes. Which made sense because of the trainer and stunt coordinator. He was the one that worked closely with Chan throughout his career.

The film was great because it steered clear of all of the ""PC"" B. S. and was just a great action superhero movie. It is all I want to see when I see a movie.

The action was INCREDIBLE. The main actor and actress that played the sister were incredible to watch. The story was also not too predictable, so it made it enjoyable.

I highly recommend watching this one to have it help kind of tie some of the old Iron man movies and some of the shows together."

After sometimee,he should go to his native town because of some reasons. How did he got that ten rings? THIS IS THE STORY.

Must Watch!"
Marvel's Inner Chi,"Shang-Chi is arguably the most original and entertaining origin story that Marvel's delivered in quite some time. Coming from someone who's slowly starting to get superhero fatigue from both sides of the aisle, this one delivers. It's a spectacle, and has a family drama that feel's Shakespearean at times. In many ways this is how I wanted the live-action version of Mulan to be."
The Visual is Major,"The Vibe of this movie is really really ""Asian"" and that's great. The story is not like what i expected but i love it. The concept is a little bit similliar like Black Panther. The friendship between Shang-Chi and Katy is wholesome. Unexpected and contain a good messages especially for Chinese.

The main thing that i really freakin love about this is the Visual and Music which is extremly amazing great! Gorgeous! Magnificent!"
"Not the most unique movie, but it's epic, action packed, and visually stunning!","I've watched this movie twice so far and I thought I'd enjoy it less on the rewatch, but I found it just as good.

Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is a very epic introduction to this character and keeps you invested in his origin story. While it's definitely not the most original story, they do a good job at making the character relatable enough to keep you emotionally invested.

Awkwafina was a nice addition to the movie and while some of her jokes were pretty corny, they still made me laugh (even on rewatch).

The highlights of the movie are definitely the bus scene near the beginning and the final beautiful action sequence. But all the action in general in this movie is pretty amazing.

While it has a different vibe than most MCU movies, the formula is definitely still there. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it would have been nice for this movie to have a bit more of a unique story.

Otherwise this is a stunning cinema experience, and even watching at home it will make you feel like you're in a movie theatre. Definitely recommend!"
This Movie was Amazing. Dont get why so much hate,"I thought this movie would suck honestly when i heard it was being made, i thought shang chi is a terrible character with no powers and then i always dread hollywood making asian movies lol.

Im chinese by the way and when i finally watched it i was blown away!!! This was best movie of the year, maybe one of the best marvel movies that didnt involve a blockbuster teamup like avengers infinity wars and end game.

So action packed, excellent script, insane graphic visuals, insane fighting choreography, alot of character depth and explorations. Well made indeed! This is the Black panther movie for all asians! I say all asians because chinese culture has affected all asian countries in the last 3000 years.

Dont let the reviews bother you, alot of these people dont know what their talking about honestly. Seen 1 person mention theirs no villain But this movie takes villain into an indepth look. For every villain theirs a drive & purpose to why they do things and for this villain it involved love. Some may not be able to comprehend this as they view villains stone cold killers maybe or just destructive no emotion type of baddies.

They wrote the script for this villain amazingly considering he was originally the Mandarin (a very stereotypical villain hated by asians). The clever way they were able to remove that racist heritage to this character was flawless, funny and amazing.

I mean cmon it was hilarious the way the villain described how his name came.

Some even complained they got lost during the whole movie which i found it hard to believe. I mean you must have Low IQ lmao go not understand n follow through the movie. From beginning to end it was a step through step process. Maybe they could have explored more about the magical lands but whois to say they wont in future movies?? All u needed to know was in the movie, and any other questions can be saved for the future just as most marvel movies always do.

The fight scenes on the Bus were off the charts and so was the rest of it. I can see theirs many chinese people hating on this film cuz they feel the fighting style is too like Chinese movies fighting style But they dont get it. What made this movie very good was the amazing way they blended chinese and western movies together. The fight scenes was neither just chinese nor was it western, it was a perfect blend.

This stories villajn was writting the way Thanos was but better. Thanos was not just crazy mad villain, he had purpose and feelings and goals that involved not just world domination or killing. Same with this villain, Tony Leung may have had not many lines in this movie but the way he carried his presence and the acting was outstanding.

I have watched tony leung in hong kong movies for 30 years now and his acting is impeccable. He brought life to the Villain he played, and gave it a more down to earth and also relatable character portrayal. Anyone in his position in the movie would have had a chance to go his path, i know many might disagree but it was so easy to see how he deviated from the good path he took for some time back to evil. You just need to understand the character and his reasons and experiences.

The main character Sima Liu i mean was pretty good choice, their were some scenes for fighting that looked to be him doing the stunts and it was amazing.

I seen some complain that the movie should have been just mandarin but thats clearly a comment made by someone from China or mandarin speaking. To them they live in the old age where black is black, white is white, theirs no grey.

Only way asians can move forward in hollywood is by a blend of both west n east.

Maybe some people might hate it cause its so much asian characters n that its got mandarin language in it, then u got others who hate it cuz theirs english in it. Both groups need to grow up and live in the year 2021 cuz this movie was so successful because of the mixture of both cultures in 1.

If this movie was just another straight chinese martial arts flick it would certainly not be successful in the west. This blend is what makes it open up to other races to watch and enjoy.

The special effects of the movie was off the charts! Amazing!! The fighting too!

This movie is the Black panther for asians. Its the opening door for asians to be introduced more commonly.

If anyone in or from China reads this i think u should think hard to yourself, Do you want to see more chinese movies succeed in the future?? Cuz if so then u should ccheer this movie on cause its gonna open doors for chinese actors n actresses.

China blocking this movie from playing makes no sense as the way for China to spread love is share their culture with all especially after the pandemic fiasco. This movie opens the doors of chinese culture up to westerners.

So support this movie! And stop bashing it for unfounded selfish reasons."
It has a ring to it...,"Everybody around me raved about this movie, but I watched it very late and now I'm slightly disappointed. It didn't live up to all the hype and all the praise but seemed very much like any other Marvel movie. But what I am truly impressed with, was the blend of martial arts in the MCU, it fit so perfectly. This wasn't just another movie with a sprinkle of Asian characters for representation, no this actually tells their story, speaks their language, and depicts the details. The fight scenes are fun, there is some light comedy, no gore, and the CGI was gooooood. The backstory and narration made the fantasy seem real.

It pulled at my heartstrings when it connected to Iron Man, I did not see that coming though it certainly made up for my disappointment with Awkwafina (Katy). The movie had a lot of slow parts and parts where I was losing interest and seemed somewhat like a good vs evil movie? Come to think of it, it felt like a Disney movie trying to teach me about Asian cultures and the inherent good in the universe.

I'll agree it was dramatic and stays with you as 20 minutes post the movie, I was trying to channel the universe with open palms and gentle hand motions. Not something I do every day."
Better than I expected!,"This was just a lot of fun. The story wasn't as tight as it could have been, but I found myself enjoying the whole movie regardless. The fight choreography was bangin', and all the action was just very well directed. Everything felt purposeful and exhilarating. The beginning of the movie feels like a straight-up martial arts movie and then as it progresses we get more and more fantasy elements working their way in which felt like a nice contrast. The music definitely felt like it added a lot here. I kept being reminded of how mixing different elements in with the more traditional orchestrated sounds really worked for Black Panther's soundtrack, and I honestly think this film did it even better. I think that, all in all, this is probably the best thing Marvel has produced since Endgame."

Story: Shang-chi(Simu Liu) who is living in USA for 10 years with his best friend Katy(Awkwafina). After sometimee,he should go to his native town because of some reasons. How did he got that ten rings? THIS IS THE STORY.

Must Watch!"
A funny and good movie for action genre.,"As a non-marvel fans, I give this movie with 10/10 score, beside the good acting and fighting style, I found this interesting culture where the Chinese fiction culture was storied.

Moreover, I watch this movie because there's one of my favorite actress, yeah she is Awkwafina who always look like silly wherever she roles any movie.

Oh yeah one more thing, honestly, all the fiction animals on this movie are disgusting."
Great MCU origin story,"I just re-watched Shang Chi on Disney+, and I enjoyed it as much as I did the first time in the theater. This movie redefines action in the MCU, and I hope it carries over into the new films going forward.

The first ten minutes are all in Chinese with subtitles. Yes, there is exposition and flashbacks in the movie as you're not going to understand the nuances of the plot, character motivations, etc. Without it. It's called storytelling. Get over it. There are references to cultural identity (as immigrants), family, and love.

Awkwafina and Simu have great chemistry. Menger is badass. Tony Leung is a legend and gives a wonderful performance as a complicated and tortured antagonist. There is great humor (not to everyone's liking it seems) and heart. My only critique is really the usual devolvement into the CGI battlefest that MCU movies always wind up becoming, but that's a minor quibble in a solid movie."
Movie for children only,"As an adult, I think this movie is a complete mess. The ancient master gets knocked out quickly while the car driver woman with 2 days of training saves the day. Everybody should point this as a big problem so maybe they would stop making this kind of situation in several recent movies. But people are always praising and giving good scores. I really can't understand. The film industry will not improve this way."
A weird mix of Marvel and Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon,"As far as Marvel being a fantasy film they generally like to be grounded in reality of history of the world and the current setting... but this one is really really going into the fantasy setting of parallel universes of Chinese myth. So for me it kinda felt totally fantastical and not really connected to any of the other Marvel universe.

The fight and chorography of the action scenes is impressive and entertaining and if a movie could be watched on that basis alone then this would do the job - unfortunately for Shang Chi you actually need a compelling story with interesting characters.... but what we got was the MASSIVELY overdone .. evil father and son who seeks redemption arc... other supporting characters were pretty much all one dimensional - either good or bad, black or white.

I also felt that Samuel Liu was miscast in the main role... If Donnie Yen was younger he probably would have done a better job. Samuel just does not have the screen presence.

Its entertaining for the kids but I think the adults will be bored."
Worth a watch with family,"RATED 8/10 Language: English Source: Hotstar RECOMMENDED

The story and making is worth to watch in big screen with good sound system. The first half is filled with great actions and funny moments and it get into serious mode in the second half.

The second half is more traditional and sentimental....the decent story and colourful visual makes this so grand... Good movie to watch with family."
A visual masterpiece,"10/10 this is my new favorite marvel movie. It has incredibly choreographed fight scenes, so much humor, and a really strong sense of heart and love. I missed movies like this."
10/10: Shang-Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings,"I feel this was, hands-down, one of the best #Marvel movies made, to date! 😁🤘🏼

Can we also appreciate the unpublicized highlights that added value and focused on inclusivity without being solely centered as the focal front of this amazing diverse action-packed production! 👏🏿👏🏾👏🏽👏🏼👏👏🏻

#Marvel #MarvelStudios #Movie #ShangChiAndTheLegendOfTheTenRings."
Can't wait to see more of these characters.,"They're loveable, likeable and human. This movie was great and my only regret was not being able to see it in theaters but that's not it's fault! I truly hope the racism that came with the pandemic doesn't impede further success for this franchise."
Truly Amazing,One of the best marvel movies in a decade. Cinematography acting jokes background score everything is on point according to story scene & actors action scenes hand to hand combat is on another level.
More of the same from the hyperactive Marvell/Disney CGI-verse,"Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) discovers that his all-powerful and millennium-old father is about to launch an attack against the magical village where Shang-Chi's mother was born in the likely mistaken belief that his wife is not dead but is rather being held captive (there is more to the plot than one sentence can sum up but what does it matter... the story is just scaffolding for the special effects). Much fighting ensues but fortunately everyone eventually learns how to 'get along' when faced with a real threat. You have seen it all before: physics-defying martial arts, monsters who look like the recently swallowed strings of LED Christmas lights, conflicted heroes with wise-cracking 'comic relief' sidekicks (an awful Aquafina and an even more awful Ben Kingsley), giant melees featuring a variety of glowing weapons (but no blood), hyper-kinetic and hyper-implausible car/motorcycle chases, and a lot of clichéd wisecracks, tough-guy dialogue, poseur slo-mo, and heroic vogueing (we're treated to the venerable three-point power landing/slide a number of times). The only novel thing the film has to offer is the excellent rendering of mythological beasts from Chinese culture; otherwise, it's an overly-long (132 minutes, which is 120 minutes too much Aquafina), derivative, repetitive, and ultimately boring entry in the bloated, jejune Micky Mouse-Marvel superhero franchise."
"An bog standard introduction, albeit one that makes me excited for the future","I thought plot was slow and the acting of the main character a tiny bit dry, but it is such a stunning, visceral experience that intrigued me to the end."
Perfect,"This film is full of surprises, and really perfect."
A must see for fans of martial arts action and Chinese fantasy,"What a great flick. The action was amazing throughout, constantly growing and changing so the fights never got boring. Awkwafina is a favourite of mine and did a great job. Family relationships really do make the most compelling of stories. We got an Antagonist that had a tragic and understandable story, he never felt 1 dimensional like so many other hero rising villains."
Just Wow,"This movie is fabulous.. Writings for every character was brilliant. Action sequences were beyon my imagination..

Worth watching...

Phrase 4 begins with a blast."
Superb!!,"I went into this hoping for fresh ideas but with low expectations and BOY was I surprised. This film was amazing! The casting, script, acting and everything else in between. Marvel really smashed this."
A visual feast.,
Didnt care for it,
Shang is lamest superhero of the decade,
A miss in the MCU.,"Hollywood trying to be too woke about being Chinese.

Always hate it when they make a villain not really a villain as to not offend anyone. Shang Chi's father is supposed to be a pure villain, the mother storyline took away a lot from the real storyline.

Awkwafina's character becoming a boss archer after one day of training was equally ridiculous.

Hopefully if a sequel is made it will be darker, though I'll admit the Mandarin was a funny touch."
A bit late getting to this.,"Personally this is top 3 comic movie.

As a fan of Chinese cinema from the 70's onwards the martial arts in this film was fluid.

Now if only DC would do a kung fu based film, it's got by far the greatest martial arts masters on its roster.

Shiva, David Cain, Bronze Tiger, Karate Kid, Casandra Cain, Richard Dragon and on and on.

Maybe a real film of soul of the dragon."
Entertained,"Simple as that, it's worth watching. Luckily I had Subtitles on for the Chinese speaking parts, and that helped, especially at the start of the movie (about 10 minutes). Don't forget the end credit scene at 2:01:46."
A chinese tale.,"I was really looking forward to this movie after seeing the trailer. I decided to wait until it comes out on Disney+.

What I saw surprised me deeply. This is a Chinese story that was probably made up by Marvel. In the movie there are a lot of fantastic beings which I really liked. The more I liked that it was a kind of karate movie. When I think about it, that was something new when it comes to Marvel. The main character seems personable and it's fun to watch his story unfold. What I can tell you is that this tells the story of how Shang-Chi got the ten rings. It is worth mentioning that the hero gained sympathy with me through his dealings with his best friend.

To come to the conclusion I would like to say that this movie is very good and deserves more recognition. Ten stars from me because it's a movie I've been waiting for."
Really good,
What's up with these extreme positive reviews?,"I watched this movie after Twitter was claiming it to be the best movie ever, so I went with high expectations, after watching what I found is movie was mediocre at best, the CGI was great but apart from it everything is just ok at the best, I didn't connect with any character at all. To be honest wait for the film to come on streaming services, not worth it to go to the cinema."
A very well-made Marvel movie that deserves a lot of praise!,"""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" is one of the best productions of Marvel Studios. I had very big expectations for this movie and it didn't disappoint, mostly because it's based on asian people and martial arts and I am a very big fan of this genre. Only the idea to make a Marvel's movie which is based on martial arts is very interesting, even If there are already some comics on which this movie is based on.

The movie has all you could expect from a movie made of Marvel, but the special effects and the CGI are the strongest points of this one. I even regret it that I didn't watch it in a cinema, because it's clear that the movie has been made to put into the light the enormous ammount of special effects, on a big screen. I've also been impressed by the acting and even the storyline it's not bad. It's clear enough that is has been put a lot of effort in the well-making of this movie and it seems to me that they really achieved what they've wanted to.

""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" it's a movie that shines through it's CGI, acting and storytelling."
Omg! Wasn't expecting it to be so stunning,"The music, the screenplay, the writing, the direction everything was on point. I went to a theatre to watch it and was literally stunned. I crave that background music. It's simply too good. Ultimately. Go for it. Best 2 hours you'll have. Wont regret it."
Ten Years too Late,
It's a Visual treat,Perfect Fantasy film to watch with full family.. you can't miss this on big screen.
"Just, wow.","You could be mistaken for reading the title and thinking I was being sarcastic.

Thankfully,I'm not. Just wow. I've been longing for that wow factor from the cinema since cinemas have reopened and this film gave me everything I wanted.

Take away the fact that I am biased towards Marvel movies (guilty) this however is just a fanboy loving that Marvel have delivered once again, by that I mean top tier movies in the realms of Black Panther, Thor 3, GOTG, Infinity wars, Spider-Man just to name a few.

From not having any major comic runs, to coming to our screens with this is jaw dropping movie, I can only show nothing but pure joy. From the culture, the mythical folklore, the mix of past/present and let's not forget the secret garden this film expands on the Marvel universe once again with an even deeper history.

This film gave me real belly laughs, real emotional moment, a fantastic soundtrack to match this is a genuine winner for this year and Spider-Man may have his hands full beating what I can only describe as the best introduction to a unknown character since BP/GOTG. Shang-Chi needs to be a new staple in the Marvel franchise with new stories moving forward. Not to mention that fantastic performance from Simu Liu which has genuinely made me yearn for more of his portrayal!

What an absolute treat and I've only watched it twice with a third viewing feeing more needed as the days go on.

5 star all day, every day. Bravo!"
Amazing.,"An iconic film with excellent combat.

Perfect new start."
Glad to know about our new lad.. BTW welcome to MCU!,MCU new characters are always astonishing. Looking ahead for timely updates.
Best action movie of 2021,Superb superb superb very very good movie must watch in theatre....
Beautifully created,
Shang - Chi Movie Review,"Marvel Studios has gained a glamorous reputation throughout the last decade, and this film was a huge milestone for superhero cinema, Asian representation, and the studio as a whole. Like Black Panther was to a lot of African-American audiences, Shang-Chi will ignite a spark in the hearts of Asians. This film opens the door to a relatable character and I love Simu-Liu's portrayal of Shang-Chi. I have watched Simu previously in the show Kim's Convenience as a comedic character and there couldn't have been better casting for Shang-Chi. Simu reflects the combination of an Asian-American character superbly and has an amazing screen presence. His character reminded me of Captain America because of his leadership role in the film, standing up against all odds, and overall amazing chemistry with the rest of the cast. Awkwafina's character, Katie, was an amazing character, filled with comedic relief that gave a lighter tone, to a film that was a little bit too dark for a Marvel film. Tony Leung's character, The Mandarin stole the show with a vengeance. Tony Leung is absolutely ground-breaking in every role he plays and The Mandarin was a unique role he took on. Leung had an amazing screen presence and was my character in the film. The visual effects in the film were unique and I could see that the animators had taken inspiration from traditional Chinese films regarding Martial Arts, also having similarities in design to Doctor Strange. The action in this film was mind-blowing like I was expecting, and I loved the fight on the bus. The soundtrack was average, with the usage of traditional Chinese instruments. The songs used in the film were composed by primarily Chinese Hip-Hop artists and I enjoyed them. The writing in this film was good, but not great. One of the criticisms I have about the film is that the plot did not feel original and could've been executed far better. There were a lot of parts in the middle of the film that stole away from the central plot of the film. This film had a more emphasis on magic and fantasy as suppose Kung Fu. Overall, this film is hands down one of the best gems Marvel has produced, and I cannot wait for Shang-Chi to integrate with the Marvel Cinematic Universe further."
"Boring, predictable, Dumb characters","Well in short This comes under my top 5 worst marvel movie My god.. Nothing interesting in this movie, not even the final battle😑 There's like no suspense at all And the main characters going to learn everything in like minutes, no need Of training, just be main character😑"
Great action movie,"I have to that this movie was great. It has a lot of action in this movie and the choreography in every fight scenes was amazing. Also, the story was interesting and it has a lot of jokes that makes me laugh every time and the CGI and the visual of this movie was great. This movie was very entertaining. This is probably the best MCU solo movie after captain america the winter soldier.

Overall, I gave it 8/10 because it was a great action movie. I like it😁👍"
One of the Best Solo Movie of Marvel,"Shang chi is One of the Best Solo movie till now in Marvel. If you are waiting to come it on OTT platform , you are gonna regret for not watching it in Theaters,(unless due to Covid-19) .

Visuals are so much OP in this movie. BGM of this movie will give you the vibes of Kung fu panda(Chinese Instruments), with some Dj snake Officials.

Martial Arts And Other Fighting Sequences are also Very Amazing in this movie.

For those who are Searching a good movie after 2 years of covid, this movie is that you should watch i.t Beware of Spoilers and you will Enjoy the movie."
Funny action movie,"This was a lot of fun to watch. The cast was great. They made their characters believable, funny, and told a great story. It held its own very well. The action scenes blend with everything they did. It's nice to watch something that takes you away, and you get lost in it. Great movie can't wait to watch it again."
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden MARVEL . . . And So MUCH , MUCH , MUCH , MORE 💎","A -BIG- Screen Mini Review. Viewed Sept. 05, 2021.

1. "" So -{ MANY }- Upsides : ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden MARVEL"" { Gosh . . . . where do I even start❓} "" : Ang Lee's circa 2000 quasi-mystical Martial arts spectacular is the -Very- first film that came to my mind whilst watching a certain beautifully -{ ' Atmospheric ' }- segment of the opening-act of 'Shang-Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings' ( ""Shang Chi"" for short ) . . . . you'll know it -Immediately- upon seeing it . . . . featuring the ""ever-amazing"" Malaysian Mega Star Michelle Yeoh ; who of course was one of the -Principal- characters in 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon', -As well- . { FYI : this is by no means intended to be a spoiler ; -several- of the movie's -official- teasers & trailers 'gallantly' feature the said scene, albeit briefly }. And what's more ...( trailers also )... if you're someone with 'even the slightest bit' of true passion for all things within the realm of sheer cinematic -{ FANTASY 🌠 }- , then you'll be absolutely -delighted- to know that Shang Chi -Also- has a distinct 'Harry Potter' aspect to it . . . & if even -that's- not enough for you . . . Then, get this, its got a 'full-blown dollop of Narnia' thrown in there for good measure, at that. To be -Really- honest, it felt a bit disorienting , -At First- , seeing all ""those types of elements"" in an 'MCU' ( 'Marvel Cinematic Universe' ) picture, but then I suddenly realized that 'Infinity War' -And- 'Endgame' both -Very- prominently feature, well ...{ a walking, -""Talking""- demolition derby of a, err, -""Raccoon""- }... in them, & I began to feel at home again, pretty darn quick.

2. "" There -Is- One 'Stark' Downside, Alas . . . .

Next Phase,
Fun Film That Does What It Is Supposed To,"Brought to you by the Truth Tellers.

Film is great overall and in this genre at least, is one of the best all year round that has been generally lacklustre. Definitely a good movie to watch as it does what it is supposed to in that it is generally a setup film for something bigger in the MCU.

Like many of the other Marvel Films in the MCU, they have to start somewhere. As an origin film it does it very well and perhaps the best origin / starting film for superhero movies that is full of action, decent story that is somewhat predictable (as it is for most origin stories) though generally fresh, fun and great characters. Definitely one to watch.

Final Verdict - Does what it is meant to do and provides the entertainment while doing it."
Best non-avengers MCU movie,"Keeping it short. This movie had it all. Great story, writing, direction, acting, villain, comedy and fight direction.

I'm a huge old school kung-fu movie fan and I was a bit sceptical about how they will show the fight scenes. Glad they kept it authentic with the fight director (who worked with Jackie Chan a lot). It was insane.

The story itself was superb. The villain's character development was amazing. The direction was not rushed and at the same time it didn't bore me for a single second.

Best non-avengers MCU movie for me. I can watch this again today after watching it last night."
Highly Overrated and Forgettable MCU Film,
Crappy story line with a big budget,The story is scripted by some white dude that eats avocado toast on a daily basis and it doesn't add value to the MCU at all. Whats the point? Better watch suicide squad instead.
Dumbing Down Cheap,"Lots of copied ideas from other films, and poorly executed. Very tossed together & cheaply not realistic.

The usual opening scene of vast armies on plains with the usual barrage of arrows. The Army of the Ten Rings is led by the usual immortal who, as usual, steals ten arm bracelets which as usual are suppose to be hidden because of their power to, as usual bring immortality & create immense destructive force. The seen before Disney style fantasy creatures (same old lion, horse, dragons, odd little creatures). The usual electrical, laser, and pressure force as our weapons. Redundant, boring, cheap to digitally reproduce. Possessor supposedly over a thousand + years develops an army that for centuries (up until now) has spread to every corner of the world (odd, I never heard of them)."
No idea what anyone else is watching.,"It's the same old at this point with these movies. Unoriginal plot. Story is bland. Predictable and the jokes are just recycled now. No idea how you could give this more than a 6 out of 10.

Really wasn't impressed at all."
The Best MCU film to date!,"Shang-Chi is full of amazing action (like awesome choreographed fights), funny actors, and a creative plot to achieve spectacular results. A surprising hit I did not expect to be this amazing."
Best Non-Avengers movie,"Just the poster alone says it all, the movie was great. Great writing, great character development, story, acting, villain, comedy and the best fights.

Like I just wrote the story was great, maybe you can say AMAZING. All of the character development was awesome to see and really entertaining. It was not at all rushed in the direction and at the same time didn't it bore me.

So save to say, it was one of the best non-avengers MCU movie for me. I would watch it again and maybe even three times after that."
Jaw dropping movie,Just watched the movie and i am speechless. The fight scenes were absolutely perfect and made my jaw drop. The character's were perfect and the little bit of comedy that was added made the movie even more amazing. If i could watch this movie again for the first time i would because the experience was out of this world.
Shang Cheese,"Totally unpopular opinion here and I might be the only one, but I really didn't like it; even going into it with no expectations. I wasn't too keen on the movie in the first place, but I was swayed by everybody who watched it and said it was brilliant. What a mistake. I felt the movie was incredibly dull, generic, utterly cliched and stereotyped. Crap characters, formulaic plot, and not even all that funny. As soon as the movie opened with a Chinese battle banner and the twang of guzheng notes, I knew it would be bad. The action and fight scenes aren't even all that great: they relied way too much on CG. I feel like the action was nothing special: Jackie Chan (and Yuen Wah whom you'll see in Shang Chi) in his hey-day produced way better action and fights without CG. Back when The Matrix first came out, that was mind-blowing action that Western audiences haven't seen before. If you've seen any number of Hong Kong martial arts movies you'll know what I mean. The third act of the movie was a total rip-off of the last battle in How to Train Your Dragon. Also an absolute waste of great actors like Michelle Yeoh who was given nothing to do, she practically dialled in her part. Positives though: Tony Leung. He's the one redeeming grace of this terrible and lazy movie."
Awful just awful,"It is not many times that you come out of the cinema with your friends and laugh about how bad a movie is but here we are. This is the Lowest of the low and this franchise has become nothing but a joke. Katy is the worst character in cinema history just shut up please jar jar 2.0, this is a disgrace to my eyes and dc is clear I see that now. If you like this movie you have problems."
Honest: A decent movie but don't expect anything you haven't already seen from Marvel.,"It's a decent movie. Happy that the comedic timing in certain scenes isn't overdone and it plays out to be a little more serious. The Mandarin in the movie by far the best acted out character and the choreography of the martial arts is on point. The movie is probably about 15 mins too long just when you think ""oh it's finishing up"" there's more. There is a notable difference in the second act with the story going more rapid and pacing is definitely the movies biggest flaw. Acting wise it's cool, nothing amazing or something you haven't seen before.

If you're familiar with marvel it's the exact same model as some of the other movies with it being about family (Thor, Black Widow).

Wanna have a good time with the family or just a decent watchable movie? This is one that you'll like."
Decent film but nothing special,"Incredibly cheesy and stereotypical superhero film. The acting was very 'meh'.

Very weak written villain.

Only redeeming parts were the cool weaponized rings and martial arts fight scenes. CGI was cool and sexy but in terms of narrative the movie was just.... soul less. Nothing new about it.

6/10 because it isn't bad per se. Decent action movie that looks good. That's about it."
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,
MMA: Magical Martial Arts,"This story is more magical than most of the other Marvel hero adventures, so it's more like Doctor Strange than Iron Man. The magical elements in the movie were a refreshing change from all the aliens we've been seeing in Marvel movies lately. However, you can watch this movie without having seen any other Marvel movies before.

The fight scenes were well choreographed, maybe almost too slick looking? They reminded me of Jackie Chan fights with how precise they were. Despite beating each other severely, no one seems to bleed in any of these fights, so it might have been better if it took the leap into R rating territory like Deadpool.

Although some scenes had slightly janky looking CGI - it was only a little sub-par in places. The final action set-piece is epic though, proving Shiang Chi is a force to be reckoned with in the MCU.

As with all the MCU movies, it doesn't take itself too seriously, with moments of humour. Although sometimes you'd wish they would be a bit more serious, I guess it's the MCU formula to add humour. It's reasonably well paced, although these movies are always longer than they need to be. Then you have to sit through end-credit scenes that hint at the mysterious origins of the 10 rings, and a potential sequel or tie in with another MCU movie.

Overall, it's not bad, a good adventure, some good fights, and a BIG finish."
Awesome.,"Best fight scenes since the civil war airport scene. They mess up simply by trying to make the character 10 years younger then the actor is. But aside from that I thought it was awesome. Plenty of cool action fight scenes, goes a little off the rails at the end with way too much cgi for what was a relatively grounded movie to start. Great addition to MCU , especially after the quality level the shows have been."
MCU G.O.A.T. (outside of avengers),"This movie had everything from a great story to some of the best visuals I've ever seen.

Shang-Chi has elevated the already high expectations from the MCU moving forward."
Beginning of Phase 4,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings takes place some time after Avengers Endgame is the beginning of phase four of the marvel cinematic universe.

Shang-Chi is an alright movie. It has some great fight scenes with some incredible fight choreography and epic large-scale battles. It is also has some good comedic scenes that made me laugh a couple of times. Where Shang-Chi suffers is when it comes to the plot. I didn't find the story very compelling and I didn't get that attached to the characters. It's a story that I feel has been done many times before.

Shang-Chi wasn't for me but it's comedy and fight scenes make up for some of it's flaws. If you are familiar with the Marvel franchise I assume you somewhat know what to expect and for you I can recommend it. Although the movie isn't that great, I still think it's good enough to the point of where it's worth watching just to keep up with the larger plot of the MCU. For those not invested in the MCU, I don't believe that this movie is the one you should start with."
DON'T TAKE AY NOTICE OF THE HIGH REVIEWS,"Clearly only people working for the film have rated it high.. Trust me don't wast your time or money, its 2hrs ill never get back.. Acting was terrible, only decent thing about the film was the special effects...."
A beautifully unique marvel movie,
"Mediocre, shallow, flat - one of the worst MCU movies",
Waste of time..,"This movie is centred around cheap laughs and gags. It takes all the bad parts of the old MCU movies and puts it into this film. A fart joke was the only thing left on the table.

I literally feel asleep in the final act since it was so bizarre. This film drags on and on and on. In 2008 this would have been amazing. I'm shocked this carry's the marvel tittle. After end game Marvel had some excellent releases that continued to work on a wonderful story such as Wanda and Falcon but this was utter trash.

If you wana watch an old school Kung fu movie then this is ok. I hope they don't drop the ball with externals tbh.

I seen a few people leave the theatre. And what's up with these over the top good reviews seems sketchy."
Kinejin,
"It's not as bad as people are saying, it's also not quite as good.",
It is fine,"The movie is fine and thats about it. It is way overhyped and marvel fans just spam review 10 stars on anything marvel related for some weird reason.

I dont know what else to say other than the story was predictable and the only good part was the visuals, the fighting and some of the actors."
Out of the Marvel patterns,"I had very few expectations from this one, given the fact that it was an origin story with a character I know zero facts about. But let me say this, it competes with the Avengers movies when comes to cinematography, visuals and action sequences.

By far the best Marvel movie in the recent years, that puts many titles from its portfolio to shame.

The visuals are a blast, a true eye candy experience. There are a lot of new elements that Marvel seemed to experience with and it worked out perfectly. The choreography is spot on, as the fighting sequences are among the best I've seen, and combined with a good score, it turns out to be a very enjoyable seeing on the big screen. I think it's mandatory to watch Shang-Chi on the biggest screen you can get to."
An amazing movie.,"I love how this movie is just realistic and unrealistic at the same time. The graphics are visually appealing, and look insane. This movie was also kind of funny as well, and I would definitely rewatch this movie as much as I can. Definitely worth watching."
Average Marvel Flick!,"Great start, especially the fight choreography between Shang Chi's parents. That was sheer awesome and so was the fight in bus where we got good humour as a bonus.

But then story gets dragged out and turns weird.

Instead of taking us to Shang Chi's universe which is about martial arts... we are to Dr. Strange's.

Dark Door, a soul-consuming monster from another realm... It was like they borrowed elements just for the hell of it.

Expected so much..."
"Honestly it's great, beautiful martial arts galore","Haven't been much of a Marvel guy even with their biggest event films, but Shang Chi is solid. Story moves quick, lots of great characters, almost nonstop action scenes, and a finale that they hid from the trailers. I was definitely way more into it than I thought I'd be. Props to the team on this one!"
One of the best marvel movies ever with the best special effects!,"Marvel keeps making better movies! This marvel era is marvelous,(pun intended) first the series, then the black widow movie and now this! This movie has such lovable characters, the hero shaun doesn't have a hero complex like iron man. And the women who play in the movies are all different. In the beginning of marvel women (in my opinion) were displayed as either a strong power woman or a sex object. Here the women are just themselfs. The storyline is something new for me, I never heard about these stories and legends before. But now I plan to do that way more often. It was a little disappointing that all the 'good' main characters survived without a scratch. Of course I am happy that they will return in these movies in the future, but it makes it less dramatic and realistic. Still it is a funny movie with a great storyline and i cant even begin to mention how great the visuals were and the special effects. One of the best marvel movies for sure!"
"Solid first half, messy second half",
A mish-mash of genres that don't work on the whole.,"The very first question to be asked would be, ""Why was this movie even made in the first place?"" It's one of those ones that tries to be too much and ultimately fails at everything. It starts off as a love story, then turns into ""Filthy Rich Asians,"" and then ends as a conventional action pic. A romantic feminist vibe is terribly present throughout the entire picture, which wouldn't be that bad if that was all it was about. But this movie has trouble settling on one single narrative. It's almost like an asian version of ""Rocky Horror Picture Show."" As is typical of this current generation of filmmaking, it's just another ""People running around doing things"" movie. The market is just saturated with these SFX garbage movies which this summer was full of!!"
Works as an introductory movie but has a boring story,"This film manages to introduce the character in this universe, but the story that unfolds is boring.

The conflict changes several times, it even takes the main character to a lake to concentrate on something else, it becomes cyclical, it is incongruous, it has many script holes, you do not feel much emotion when the fights appear. The visuals are very good, the editing is good most of the time, although the sound of some mythological elements is not very good, like the performance of the actor who plays the antagonist, the ending feels a bit forced.

This film is not innovative in the genre and is predictable, making it somewhat boring."
Very well done,I mean this move was just a fun ride from start to finish with secrets and just really good nods to Asian mythology.
Boring,"I found this very slow moving and boring.

Special effects are silly looking.

Drags on. Ends. Tells you this is the start of a whole new Marvel strand. Oh dear."
"Not bad , not great",Honestly I start doubting that I saw another movie ! I don't know what all the hype about !! Another Marvel movie packed with a lot of action scenes and visual effects but weak and predictable story !
When will Disney learn?,"I heard great things on the internet about this movie, so I had some pretty high expectations. Well, I was let down, and judging by the other reviews ALOT of other people were too. People are not going to put up with this crap for too much longer. I mean how many bad movies can Disney make in a row and expect people to continue to watch them?

I see Disney even tried to even throw some Anti American talk into this movie to try to get on China's good side....but even that did not work. China did not allow their citizens to watch it. I guess Disney will have to put even more Anti American talk into the next movie.

You messed up Star Wars Disney. Now you are messing up every Marvel movie. Maybe wokeness is not the way to go. PLEASE can someone buy Marvel from Disney before its too late??

3/10 Another very poor Disney Marvel movie."
Underwhelming in every way,"Stupid on every level. Fights are entertaining, but would rather watch any bad 70's chop socky movie over this poorly written, ludicrous story. Several of the characters are so unrelateable it makes me wonder if the writers, director or actors have ever met another person. Not worth the time to write this review except that somehow this is getting a 7.9 at this moment which cannot be real. IMDB should be embarrassed shilling for this mess."
Wow how terrible,This new marvel movie is just bad. The main actor can't act and it's more about the side characters then him.
Did I see a different movie?,
Simu Liu seem to be a nice guy...,"...and a decent actor, but he couldn't save my intrest for another moneymilking lack of substance Disney/Marvel production. Watched for 30 min and turned off because of the s*itty socalled music tormented my ears. It's just another predictable, trendvictimized hipster infested snore fest with a billion dollar special effects and no surprises, just another marvel movie for modern pop kids and i*iot sheep, only this time they wanna target the asian community. Asian people must be appalled and ashamed by this pile c*ap. And speaking of asians, what's the deal with that sidekick actress, she sounds exactly like S Johansson but more chronically butthurt, is she doing a voiceover? Bloody hell..."
"Black Panther, but better","I wasn't really excited about MCU when Phase 4 was announced, but even then there were some things I was excited about and this movie wasn't one of those things. However, I liked it.

I wasn't disappointed like I was with Black Widow which massacred Taskmaster so bad.

It reminded me a lot of Black Panther. Non-white foreign protagonist, modern music and annoying sidekick.

But here is a twist. This movie does a way better job than Black Panther.

Humor was funnier, Katy didn't say anything cringe, we got real Mandarin and CGI battle didn't feel like PS2 cutscene.

If you want to watch an MCU movie from Phase 4 before No Way Home comes out, watch this.

Also, Eternals was awkward."
Yet another Superhero flick focused more on visuals and (forced) comedy,
Very overrated,"Definitely just watched another Marvel movie, nothing much else here. Felt very formulaic and chick heavy like many of the other films, would've liked to see them change things up a bit."
A fresh entry to the MCU!,"After being disappointed by Black Widows' solo outing and not knowing anything about a minor comics character I feared for Shang-Chi. But I was not disappointed.

Straight off and you get a cultured vibe honouring Asian film and tradition and you get superb action and charismatic characters all well delivered by a strong cast.

Reminding me of Jackie Chan in his heyday, the martial arts is fast and creative. Shang-chi feels really grounded and fresh for the first half of the film and it's good to move away from too much wild. But then the second half blends Asian folklore and Marvel fantasy to truly deliver a spectacle. Without having to explain itself too deeply the consistent nods to Dr Strange remind you that other dimensions exist and people can bend powers in believable ways.

Whilst it may not have needed to go so far onto fantasy, any true Marvel fan knows this is just another tuesday. The performances are strongly delivered and Shang-Chi is likely to become a new fan favourite."
"Generic, excessive jokes and lazy writing",The Marvel Studios once again makes a movie that uses jokes instead of making a good character development.
Nonsense,"Nonsense dumb time wasted.

Lots of dumb jokes Nothing new Weak story Making fun of male characters is not nice and we don't want to see that."
Stop Disneying our Marvel Dammit,"Couple of things, 1. The actors are made of plastic, I know it wasn't a CGI cartoon but the actors were so one dimensional it may as well have been. Have never seen live actors display the uncanny valley. 2. Feels alot more like a Disney film and less like a Marvel super hero movie. 3. It was super formulaic, Awkwafina was as usually not funny and every little chuckle was super forced. Overall had some good fight choreography but you can get that in any other Kung Fu Movie. Kind of makes you wonder why so much money was spent on a very very very template movie. Kind of lame."
Shang-Chi is top tier Marvel,"From the beginning I was fooled believing it would be a cliche origin story but completely shattered my expectations by the end. This movie is extremely fun and will leave you stunned by the end. The choreography of the fighting was flawless and give no disappointing action scenes. There aren't any groundbreaking performances especially by the lead. This doesn't take anything away from the film though and I am confident he will improve and become more comfortable. Don't leave during the credits!

Absolutely needs to be seen in theaters! Great movie."
More storyless woke.,"So bad. Between this and eternals, marvel is in big trouble. Marvel seems to have given up on any overarching story now that avengers is over and will instead focus on creating woke nonsense over and over."
Basically Marvel version of Tokyo Drift,"This movie isn't really written that well. It's more hilarious especially if you know what's going on in China and how MMA fighters go around debunking Chinese martial arts and the government is stepping in to censor it for the sake of protecting their pride / propaganda. Shang-Chi basically felt like an extension of that.

The acting is overexaggerated and to be honest the movie forces more stereotypes on Asians than relieve it. At least actors like John Cho plays roles that puts an even footing with their other counter parts. This movie is more of a marvel's attempt to please the Chinese market for profit. Best way to describe this movie is it's 90's nickelodeon kid show acting combined with Tokyo drift level of Asian stereotype. There's not one scene where they're not bringing attention to the fact that there are Asian people in the movie. It feels very California in only the worst ways possible."
IT WAS FANTASTIC🔥🔥🔥,"The was really good better than I expected,it has a great story,best hand to hand fight scene and more! I can't wait to watch it again more than 10 times I absolutely love this🔥."
Generic Superhero Movie,"Finally after much procrastination, I've decided to give this movie a watch, that is after Disney+ had added it to their listings.

All I can say is, I was glad I didn't fork out money to watch it in the theatres. Period. It's just another Disney movie where you walk out of the theatre and ask your kids what they have learnt from it. And for adults, you could generally pick out very generic learning points easily.

I was very surprised that Eternals received more criticism than this movie."
The worst Marvel movie,"An extremely boring film with absolutely predictable plot that is not worth paying attention to.

Medium acting, but Katy... Total cringe in 90% of the movie.

Fighting scenes is good."
A silly goofy boarderline cartoon,"This should be considered an animated film based on the amount of terrible cartoon like CGI utilized. From ""floppy"" animation used in place of human stunt people for MANY of the fight scenes (sorry, but martial arts are a lot less impressive when there are no actual people involved) to the terrible Avatar looking backgrounds and even cars / buses. For the amount of money put into a film like this I would hope the effects would be better than an episode of Game of Thrones, but instead they looked like the Matrix part 2. All of the actors involved were fantastic - when it was actually them, not a CGI stand in, but the story was all over the place, the villain(?) made no sense, I honestly have no idea what the hell was going on in the last half hour compared to the first hour. This movie was a mess all around, and compared to other MCU films feels like a total cluster-F. Definitely the worst movie I've seen this year, possibly in the last 10 years."
Very mediocre.,Another very mediocre movie from this dying 'universe' but some fight scenes are quite good and visual it's mostly ok too. Better than Capt Marvel. Hence the two points.
"Over-rated, like Black Panther","Before anyone thinks I am a straight white male who is not allowed to have opinions- let me tell you I am asian myself. Now the movie is truly overrated. Action is good, Virtue signaling was limited but not absent. Cliche MCU formula really is off putting. The only novelty was the looks of the actors. I did not get overly bored but I would not have missed much if I did not watch it."
Martin Scorsese Was So Right,"Martin Scorsese called most of these generic MCU movies theme park movies and This movie is perfect example of that. There are some great MCU movies, but seems like Marvel isn't even trying to separate themselves from theme park stigma, when they make movies like this."
An American Chinese movie,"I liked this movie, one of the first American movie where a lot of the dialog is in Chinese. The movie in it self is not fantastic but is has it's moments. I just can't stop thinking about why this hd to be set in the Marvel universe, it makes no sense to me...but then I am no Marvel fan. I think it would have been much better a completely chinese movie set in a different universe separate from Marvel. But hey, this is an American movie after all."
"Great humour, disappointing story","I really wanted to love this, and it had some great elements, especially in the front half of the movie. Some excellent characters with great interactions and genuine laugh out loud moments.

But eventually it morphed into a predictable and very underwhelming story. I was really hoping for a clever twist or unexpected plot element but was letdown and came away a bit disappointed.

Looooots of various martial art styled fight scenes, so if you like that you'll love the movie."
Marvel is going down the drain...,"This movie is pure insult in first 10 minutes alone. Awful CGI, just ridiculous. Bullshido kung-fu nonsense. Blant BMW commercial. Autotune mumble rap."
Probably one of the worst MCU movies,
Strong 7/10,"I have just watched this movie. I am an avid Marvel fan. This film introduces a new character, there is that standard Disney approach, with a mix of comedy, seriousness and lots of action.

Disney work through the numbers on this film, there are no surprises and it does what it does on the tin.

The acting is good, special effects are solids and the story is not bad.

There's continuity linking to the other marvel universe which is nice for the fans.

I would actually pitch this at 7.5/10, not quite an 8 but higher than a 7

Those review of 1 or 2 out of ten are way off the mark, this film is not that bad."
Wow!,"I was not expecting that, I had visions of a film along the same lines as Snake Eyes, that was an out of date bagel, this was a four course banquet.

Fast paced, energetic, and relentless, not particularly the genre I normally go to, or enjoy, but I loved every second of it, a visual masterpiece. Superb acting, terrific musics, but it's produced in such a magical way, it is stunning.

I plan on seeing this again, just to understand a few bits a little more.

Go and watch it, you'll love it, 9/10."
Predictable,"I found the movie enjoyable in parts but there were some boring parts too. It's definitely not a 10/10 movie, in fact nowhere near. It's a decent film that doesn't take itself to seriously but like all of these type of films it's predictable."
Visuals compensate for the lack of script depth,"One again the studio brings jokes and the dazzling visuals over a good character development. After one hour, you don't care for the characters. Dysfunctional drama in the family and the chosen one - we have seen this a million times.

This is the first time I felt sleepy for an action movie. I feel like i wasted my money, despite availing the Super Tuesday offer. The Suicide Squad was far much better in terms of storyboard.

Over-rated, like Black Panther What's next - Shang-Chi: Origins?"
Is it over yet,"I watched the movie in real 3D, the 3D part was wonderful, but that's where the Wonder ends. The storyline was, well there was no storyline. There was no depth to the characters, 2 hours into the movie I was hoping that it would just be over already. Very disappointing movie."
Great visuals but horrid storyline.,This is well done as far as special effects but the plot is so boring I couldn't take it and left in the middle of the film.
more of a childrens movie,"I enjoyed the idea, going for a crouching tiger, hidden dragon vibe but it just lacked authenticity. Really bad over acting and cheesy action with dated CGI i swapped over to listening to music while watching it and i enjoyed it much better."
Shang Chi was disappointing,
Amazing,Shang-Chi was honestly amazing. The cinematic experience was great and the story and plot of the movie was very good too. I am a huge marvel fan and it makes me happy to see that they are branching out to different types of hero's from all types of backgrounds. To sum up my review I really enjoyed it and highly recommend. (stay for the credits to the end)
Pretty but still yet another paint-by-number Marvel rubbish,"The movie looks great but...the story and how it is being moved forward is so predictable I could almost call out every 'event' before they even happened.

Marvel is a in a creative rut. Every movie they put out is 'pretty and shallow'. I mean, I like empty calories as much as the next person - but that doesn't mean I can sit and eat a pound of it - which is exactly what watching a Marvel movie translates to.

2/10.

Wish I had watching something completely different."
Good VFX but incoherent and cliché,
Absolutely shocking,"Awful film I wish I could get my money back, waste of time just awful."
Boring,"I was really hoping to like Shang-Chi but I couldn't because of mainly three reasons: the first one is the most severe and it is the fact that I found myself very bored, especially in the last hour. I spent that time hoping that I could have the ability to skip 10 second at will like on YouTube. The second problem is the fact that Shang-Chi itself is not an interesting character as far as this movie treats him. He surely has potential and it is clear that Marvel will be high on him in the future and I still have hope but in this movie I think I preferred at least four characters more than him and he is the protagonist. And finally the plot has various holes, especially regarding the Ten Rings as a criminal organization. The visuals and the action are good but it wasn't enough for me to like this movie.

PS: the mid-credit scene is the best of the movie, really liked that one."
Not as Good as Some Reviews Say,Overall it's nothing new or very creative. I have no idea why some people pretend like it's new coming of movies. It's not. It's meh at best. Wait for streaming!
Absolute Banger!,"That was a freakin' blast! The story is complex and interesting it fills some gaps in the MCU and simultaneously is a great origin story for the character of Shang-Chi.

The whole cast is amazing, I mean there is so much chemistry between them. Simu Liu and Tony Leung are phenomenal in their respective roles. The Mandarin tho...so well created character.

The movie is amazing bridge between East and West culture. There is so much to explore, much like Wakanda. The history of Shang's culture is so rich.

The fight choreography is absolute kick in the gutts...in a good way. I mean this is something completely new for the MCU and they deliver it again! Everything looks so goddamn good and I can't help myself thinking about some scenes! Also, the colors, the effects, the camera work and etc. Everything is magnificent.

There is humor for sure, but there is also emotional impact. This is not some bland action packed movie, it's made with heart from fans for the fans. Kudos to the director Destin Cretton!

Killer soundtrack and the main song for the movie ""Run It"" fits so good with all.

There are a few surprises, that were hidden from the promos and trailers and man...just wait to see them.

About the credit scenes...they are two, both are good, but one of them is...SICK!

For sure deserves more than one viewing in the cinema, so much story building, details, action, fun. The people who underestimated this movie will be so surprised how great is it."
Shang-Chi,"I was really looking forward to this film, and was excited to see shang chi in the MCU. It started out good with an interesting father, and son character development. As the film continued, it seemed to rely very heavily on the CGI. After a while all the CGI felt bloated and overwhelming. The acting was well done, by everyone in the film no weak links. Was hoping this film, would have had a more grounded plot like Iron Man."
YAWN,This was by far the most boring MCU title I've seen to date. It was basically two hours of the same fight scene done over and over. I really hope this isn't indicative of the direction the MCU is headed post-Endgame.
WAAYY over-rated.,I thought this movie was long. 2 hrs 12 min. Felt more like 2.5-3 hrs. I was ok at first but as it went on I got bored and couldn't believe it felt so long. There were other people laughing and enjoying his side-kick comedy. It was all too 13 yr. Oldish for me. Not a bad movie but NOT a 8.1 tho. 5-6. AVERAGE.
Movie is quite good to watch,"I started to watch the movie with no expectation. The movie started well. The bus fight is very good compared to other fights.

Thought the movie is lagging still it is interesting at times.

Actor acted well.

Sure shot win for marvel."
It's ok home-watching movie,"The plot is as predictable as other predictable movies. So there's nothing interesting to expect, except for the acting of Tony Leung Chiu-wai and the funny moments of Awkwafina. They saved the movie. The kungfu is good and beautiful. Anyway, I felt asleep sometimes. So the movie is ok for watching at home, not at the movie theater."
Long but enjoyable,"I'm not a fan of Marvel movies. Not because I don't like them, but more simply because I never had enough time to see them all, thus losing all the connections between the various plots.

Fortunately, this film also seems to work on its own, except for a few passages that deserve some more knowledge.

Of course, like the films of the universe it is a part of, this film is all too perfect. There isn't a smudge and not even the secondary characters never even look disheveled.

It will seem counterintuitive, but personally when you see something so neat, I lose interest because it will seem too fake.

Even some dialogue, especially at the beginning of the film, seems so stupid that it sounds irritating.

That said, the film still works, entertains and has its right emotional charge to make you follow the film to the end without ever getting bored.

The characters are interesting and it's easy to get attached to them. Like all Marvel movies, I guess we'll see them again soon, and this movie was a nice way to introduce them to us. Ultimately, a movie that you will enjoy even if you are not a huge Marvel fan."
Another ruined opportunity.,"The whole thing is like a BMW commercial, shot in Narnia with a few urban dancing (pardon me, ''kungfu'') elements. The rest of the time it's just boring you to death. With an incredibly annoying cast (e.g. The goofy sidekick cliché) with typical lame one-liners that aren't even close to funny. A predictable plot, full of reprehensible contemporary vlogger content. However good the choreography might be, if it's the only thing that stands out, it's simply a bad movie.

Also, this overhyped soundtrack is absolutely nothing special. Terrible even. Just some famous poppy tunes varied with some derivative oriental sounds.

Too bad Marvel seems to be truly unable to create anything for somewhat more intelligent adults.

Oh, and for the wokers among us... ''I only bet on Asian'', nothing racist about that at all. Chicks can bust a guy's balls without expecting anything in return, nothing sexist about that at all. I could go on, but you get the idea."
Predictable and Bad Acting,"Incredibly disappointed in the film, instead of adding to the great Marvel empire the film belongs in a Disney cartoon.

The character'Katy' adds no benefit to the story line, with very poorly performed / written jokes and she only takes away from the sisters story and highlight characters. The ending of the film was incredibly predictable and I hope they do not continue the story line in future MARVEL films despite the final scenes."
Ben Kingsley FTW,"Ben Kingsley won this movie. And it was not particularly close. Probably the stunt coordinator came in a distant second? Anyway, I did laugh quite a bit, and the fight scenes were better than your average Marvel film...but not everything was better than average. Most of it was just about average, actually. Special effects: average. Characterization: average. Plot twists: average. I still enjoyed myself, and still appreciated Marvel transforming an exploitative property into something culturally rich. But the diminishing returns of Marvel joints continues."
Fresh,Felt like an early Marvel movie. The movie focuses on one quality story without the need for crossovers to make people see it.
A return to good Marvel movies,"If you are like me, from the previews and ads you thought this was a Kung Fu movie about a son rebelling against his crime lord father and the father sends men to force him to return and make him take over as the next leader of the criminal empire. Not an awful plot but not that original either. That is absolutely NOT what this movie is about. I love and hate that Marvel's trailer seldom give anything away and I am glad they are doing it again. That is not at all what this movie is about and I will not spoil anything.

The performances are good, the story is good and while not complicated, it keeps your interest. Funny parts, touching parts, action parts, it is overall just a good movie that was enjoyable to watch. It is not one of the best Marvel movies but it is a solid one and worth seeing in the theater."
Bad acting in a nauseating CGI crapfest,"The first thing that jumps out at you here is how uneven the acting is compared to the usual Marvel movies. Actors alternate between overacting, pathos and subdued attempts at coolness. Add the usual Marvel style self-referential wink wink humor, and the obligatory 30 minute CGI showdown with purple light themed villains and monster (for the... 15th time now?), and you end up with a jarring, nauseating tonal mess of a movie.

It's the same movie over and over again, same exact story beats, same pacing, same style soundtrack, same jokes, same trashy special effects laden battle at the end.

They tried to gimmick things up with Kung Fu here (because that's apparently what Disney think people want to see in movies with an Asian cast), but you've seen it all before dozens of times, and better at that. The martial arts fight in public transport has been done to death (recently quite well in ""Nobody"", but also in Marvel films like Captain Marvel), and in general the fights pale against movies like Matrix, John Wick or any Jackie Chan classic.

The reality is that Marvel movies feel dated and played out, with nowhere to go except from one CGI battle to the next. Maybe Marvel would be better off switching to a series format, because the movies are just reheated microwave dinners at this point.

Save your money for something original."
Short - changed,Usual kung fu fantasy action ... all been done before as has the story line ... boring waste of money and time. This constant response working of the same story lines using the same themes show that commercial film making is in a very narrow cul de sac ..
Marvel goes mystical,"With this film, Marvel shows that there is still no end in sight, and it is getting crazier and more imaginative. The most interesting Marvel world so far, with interesting mythical creatures that you won't find anywhere else. Definitely a visually stunning film, but in which you should definitely deal a little with Far Eastern culture. Not a classic superhero film. On the contrary: Marvel is becoming mystical."
Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,"A simple yet surprisingly decent marvel flick that pays tribute to Chinese culture authentically with Western twists. As an Asian, the most wondrous part of Shang-Chi's cinematic journey is the inclusion of Chinese mythical creatures created with World Class CG. The action scenes are also reminiscent of the top Hong Kong martial arts movies. You have to remember that this is a Marvel Studios movie, so do temper your expectation for the storyline a little, its more style over substance. My biggest gripe is the casting. We've been waiting to see Asian Super Heroes on a global stage, I just find it hard to believe that it is Liu Simu who has very little charisma, and seems way out of his league for this big of a role. Awkwafina provides great comedy relief, and is a fantastic addition to the Marvel Universe, I also find it unfair for the Asian community that she is built to be the love interest. Is it this difficult to sexualize Asians in Hollywood?"
not good,Don't believe the hype this movie was just as good as black widow....which is not good at all.
A hollow experience,"Judging by the level of other Marvel movies this was definitely a miss.

There is no humour. No sense of fun. It feels like a generic kung fu movie and that we have seen it all before.. I saw the ending way before we got there and above all, it was boring.

Awkwafina was intensely annoying as ever with her grating personality and spouting exposition all the time.

Marvel are really missing the mark with a lot of their latest offerings, just phoning it in like with Star Wars movies."
Ok. New fantasy type hero,This is ok movie.. After along time. New hero arrives. Not bad willing to watch till the end. Fantasy type of a vibe. Good music and background score. Must watch in a theatre. Amazing effects. But the end is little bit .. not enough type.
Its Okay,"Its Okay, not great- the first half of the movie was better then the second half, they kind of lost me once they introduced all the fantastic beasts. I just want to know why i should care about Shang-Chi, would of been better to introduced him in a previous movie like endgame threw the portals- im sure in the future of the mcu this movie will become more relevant, and he will play a bigger part, but the sad truth is take away the MCU connections and i would not have even watched this movie."
Boring,"Good CG,that's all. As a chinese, I dislike this moive not beacuse any stupid political or racial reason,just because the film script is too old-fashioned, too boring,too illogical."
Hello! Script writers?,"Not that I expect coherent storylines from Disney, but good grief, this film was a mess. It's all over the place!

Here's a little tip for the people who wrote this: pick a tone and stick with it!

Good CGI and very good action set pieces. Hence three stars instead of one. Other than that - this is the normal generic Marvel phase 2 dross.

Oh, and Awkwafina is unwatchable! She's more like an irritant than an actress.

P. S. I'm incredibly suspicious of the o.t.t. Positive reviews this film is getting on here. Bots?"
the worst,This is a pc movie nothing good to see move along.
great start but the fictionary world didn't fit in for me,"Started like a mix between martial art and the marvel universe. I found it something special and liked it a lot just until the journey starts and another world opens. From there on we came into a fiction world with dragons and monsters.

It's there that this flick lost my attention towards the story. It takes a while before the action comes back in. But once the fights are on, the effects are really stunning.

Mixed feelings aboutthe result, not bada fter all but with the other world coming in, it lost some points in the rating for me.

Nevertheless, some funny parts here and there added and they worked out fine.

Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 5/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 1/5."
Fell asleep during the movie and my kids didn't want to finish it,"As an Asian man, I really wanted to like this movie. But it was just not good. I fell asleep multiple times during the movie and my kids didn't even want to finish the movie. Unfortunate."
Chinese propaganda and horrible movie,"I wept internally for 2 hours and 12 minutes that I had to spend watching this utter fiasco and abomination interwoven with Chinese propaganda. If you are entertained with ""cool"" karate kicks, ""jokes"" that make you turn away from the screen in embarrassment and agony mashed with ridicule for western culture and and are eager to welcome your new despotic Chinese capitalist overlords, my god you will be thrilled."
One of the worst Marvel movies,"Everybody was kung fu fighting for 2 straight hours and it´s just bad.

It starts okay, then it just gets worse by the minute.

If this is the new direction Marvel is headed, then it´s just sad.

Really a bad movie and the story is rubbish, acting is bad and the best thing is that I saw it for free."
Fantastic movie!,"This movie is much better than black widow, it's funny, it's exciting, and full of adventure!

Must see this summer!"
Dissapointing,"Rotten Tomatoes makes it seem like it's on same level with Spider-Man 2 or The Dark Knight, but it's not even close to same level. It's most basic mcu origin story possible. What's the point of these scores when one movie is masterpiece (Spider-Man 2) and another is super mediocre (Shang-Schi), but both have same rotten tomatoes score. It makes no sense."
Great visuals but slow moving,"Well the fight scenes were exciting , the story was incredibly slow. Not the best Marvel movie but not as weak as movies like Thor: The Dark World. Some of the best visuals in any movie I have seen which helps improve the overall experience. Keep an eye out for a fun character to pop up as well!"
"Simu Liu, The Beta Male Brie Larson",
Reposting this review again.,
Not a superhero movie,"This is not a superhero movie. It's more of a kungfu chinese hero genre. Would prefer more mcu tech, less fantasy 'dragon' and mystical creatures CGIs, which are weird when set in a Earth-based context."
"I am so disappointed,.",
Mired by terrible cgi and choppy editing.,"The story overall is fine and typical with the MCU. Simon Liu is likable as the title character. He definitely has charisma. Michelle Yeoh and Tony Leung are both welcome additions to the MCU. And having Ben Kingsley back was great. He steals all the scenes that he's in.

Unfortunately, the cgi was terrible in this movie. It was so distracting. I wish things were shot on location. The green scene backgrounds were so obviously. The bus fight scene was boring because you could tell they were on a set with cgi roads and buildings in the back ground. The fight scenes are poorly edited and choppy. They are not coherent at all. And of course Awkwafina was miscast. She needs to stay away from movies."
Logical inconsistency,"OK The wearer of the rings can defeat entire armies.

But she can beat him.

But, she gets killed by a gang of thugs.

*That, if it is to be plausible, did not seem to get an enduring explanation of any kind.

He, a changed man, put his rings in a box.

She, the wife, did move? From the guarded garden?

Did she loose a home court advantage when she moved out of the hood?, (If that is even the case)?

Out from the land protected by the converging trees.

Nice appearance by Ben Kingsley and generally great stroke of comic relief characters, In the casting.

It's really great to see an outfit like Marvel really give important roles to people of color to Asian folks All of whom make our world go beautifully around. However the falcon and the Winter soldier did a great great disservice to global cooperation making the pursuit of which seemed like some kind of evil activity."
Average but far fetched,"Not a big marvel fan or superhero film fan so I was never going to love this. But having liked the last 3 Spider-Man's and hearing good things about this as well as being stuck with 16hrs flying I decided to watch it on the planes built in system.

Wasn't particularly impressed. Too far fetched for me to enjoy and I just didn't enjoy the story.

The headless creature and scouse guy were interesting additions. It is watchable if you're not expecting much.

Overall, I wouldn't recommend unless you love extremely far fetched non fiction superhero movies."
Fresh!,Enjoyed the movie so much! The cast was awesome and I love the banter between Shang and Katy. Wenwu is my favourite villain in MCU history so far. His character was incredible.
Great Visual Effects,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is the latest Marvel superhero movie that stars Simu Liu as Shang-Chi who is forced to confront his past after he was drawn into the Ten Rings Organization headed by his father played by Tony Chiu-Wai Leung. Shang and his sister Xialing played by Meng'er Zhang had witnessed their mother's death and work together to avenge her legacy and to protect the lands that her people came from. The plot was fun to watch with great visual effects and great supporting cast that also included Awkwafina as the hero sidekick along with Michelle Yeoh who helps train Shang the ways of his mother's unique way to defend. After all these years we now learn what happened Ben Kingsley and how he ended up with the organization after his encounter with Iron Man. Overall great movie with a wonderful cast, definitely add this to your must see list."
The ending could have been better.,To be clear this is a very good and enjoyable movie. With amazing fighting and combat sequences. However by the end the quality of the combat is watered down by the end fight which is a generic CGI fight against a monster.
By far my favorite Marvel movie.,"The action, I can actually see what's going on.

For some reason I was fighting my tears for the last 20 minutes of the movie. This story is well done.

And the actor that plays Shaun, amazing talent."
Such a mindblowing,It ia one of the best movie on 2021. With great story and VFX. All the characters are perfrom their character like realistic. And the last fight scene was so cool ans full of goosebumps.
Great introduction to the MCU,"A little sceptical at first as this came in user the radar with no real build up and hype like previous MCU films. However, it did not disappoint. Decent storyline with brilliantly choreographed (and obligatory far fetched) fight scenes.

Post film credits setting up for the next Dr Strange and Shang-Chi films. Can't wait!!"
Marvel Asian superheroes,"This probably the first Marvel film with Asian leading actor (Shiang Chi) that I know of.. well apart from Wong & Ted.

The casting managed to captive our attention and pretty much with action package.

However the only makes me not really happy is that the CGI for the battle against the ""thing"" is way look like a computer games characters CGI, such a lousy editing.

Apart from that - Shiang Chi is worth your attention. Cant wait for Shiang Chi join the Avengers."
Quality Marvel movie.,"Props to Dianey/Marvel on making a differwnt movie! It seems like it's embedded a lot of fighting styles (eg. Kung Fu) into one movie. This is different from a traditional Marvel movie, thus, makes it amazing!"
Good character building but....',I liked the characters but this is a superhero film. The action wasn't great and they never explained the powers of the rings. It's hard to know how much to appreciate a fight when the power of the rings are unknown/limitless. The last battle is a let down as well and could have featured the main character more.
The fight never ends,"Fighting will only bring harm and hatred. If you hurt others, the relatives and friends of this person will seek revenge from you again. When is the time to avenge the grievances, I hope this world can fight less, and learn to let go of the hatred in the heart and give others appropriate tolerance."
Little expectations equals a good time,
Sequel please,"Without a doubt the best action sequences in a marvel film and the best action scenes too. One of the best marvel films also. A great story and great acting. Loved this film.

Sequel please!"
Okay,"This movie was ok. Great action, decent story. Good one time watch. Just like any other marvel movie. For a hero it was a great watch. Didn't like the origin story but can't wait to see him in future marvel."
Good for a boring evening but that's it,"Besides a few good action parts which do not make to much sense sometimes, the movie plot is thin as rice paper and rolls on too common storyline plots used in hundreds of movies. Add to that a few cringy moments and you get a 5/10, not worth more."
One of the worst ever,"I've been waiting for this movie for a long time, but it was a huge disappointment.

A very boring movie, a silly, naive childish story.

& those who played Katy, I have never seen a more ridiculous or worse actress than her in my life. I could not bear to see her, and every time I heard her voice, that was a real torment, in the worst nightmares I could not find something worse! Hearing her voice for a minute worse than tormenting for eternity in the worst prisons in the world!"
"All mouth, no trousers!","Great visuals...but one of the most boring storylines ever!

Very few fight scenes, weird soundtrack, very rushed...and Awkwafina is one of the most annoying people I've ever seen - 2nd only to Melissa McCarthy!

I'm not really a Marvel fan, but I just thought this would be better."
Barely acceptable,
Same old lame a** marvel story,
Skip this movie!,"Bland pandering to the Chinese market with mystical martial arts and nothing explained. There's no tie in with main marvel universe that drives plot forward, just pointless cameos that amount to a shrug emoji from the other MCU heroes. Don't pay to see it if you can avoid it."
Marvel needs to just go away,"Not sure how to review this movie, all I could think about was the other Chinese movie ""The Great Wall"". Effects were really good, but the movie was to slow for me."
It's ok,"In simple words, this movie is full of stereotypes buffed with overuse of CGI. In other words, this is more a Disney movie than a Marvel.

Plot is as simple as it gets. If you had watched the trailer, from the 1st moments of the movie, you'll know exactly what will happen and in what order. At that point, Marvel usually throws in a few surprises. Not in this one. Everything goes smoothly from an action fantasy children movie.

Acting is great. Everyone plays their roles to perfection. There's nothing to complain here.

CGI is, like I said earlier, more Disney than Marvel. Remember the Lion King remake where it didn't feel right. It's the same here. Looks gorgeous at first sight but fails to connect emotionally.

In Summary, there are entertaining moments, but the writers room clearly saved the good stuff for future movies. This one is just a filler to introduce a late character."
Better than I expected,"When I saw the trailer a while back I wasn't expecting much, especially after Black Widow which was imo the worst MCU movie. However, the movie surprised me. The theme of a different culture reminded me of Black Panther but I enjoyed Shang Chi a lot more. I found it refreshing, the visuals were amazing, I enjoyed the action scenes very much. The plot wasn't the worst, but I felt like it was dragging out at times.

Overall a very fun and enjoyable movie."
Plot's mediocre,I could already guess the end watching only half of the film. It's like an 80's Chinese martial film.
The worst marvel movie... but beautiful effects and fights,"The movie starts good...but...soon begins the flashbacks and the nosense humour and anti-climax scenes. And then the ""mandarin"".... Seriously, this shang chi movie is the worst marvel movie of all. Its sad because the pricipal actor does his job well, but all the other characters are bad to the bone."
Masterpiece,"Best movie marvel made imo.

And probably my best theatre experience."
One of the Best Marvel Movies of This Year,"This movie portrays a villain that by far has been the best out of all the other Marvel antagonists. It shows his personal conflicts, his purpose, as well as his cruelty. The hero of this film are overshadowed by this, but the ending really makes a mark on the audience. Also the martial arts and action scenes are a treat to watch and the core of the film is about family."
"If You Have Zero Creativity, You Might Be Perfect to Write MCU Movie!","Right now only MCU movie that actually has any passion behind it is Spider-Man No Way Home. Shang-Chi was just another generic origin story, but of course i went to see it, just so i could write this review."
Bored one of the worst marvel,So bored! I hardly cared about the characters. Bloated special effects that was style over substance.
Top tier MCU,"Solid performances, some of the best action sequences in the MCU, visually stunning and likeable characters. This film is not only an achievement for a marvel film but also a film on its own."
Overrated,Extremely overrated movie for no reason at all. It doesn nothing new. Only thing marvel has left is Spider-Man right now. Everything else is just super meh.
Worst story and plot ever.,"This is by far the most nonsensical plot in a Marvel film and one of the worst stories I've ever witnessed. It's so hard to make sense of anything at all in this film. The only good thing is some of the action sequences. Bus fight is spectacular but after that it goes completely downhill cause only after that does the plot actually unfold. And it is so ridiculous and so full of nonsense that I was thoroughly bored whenever anything other than the fight scenes were on.

I think Marvel is done. This phase seems completely relying on the success of the previous one. The only good thing is Spider-Man and I'm eagerly looking forward to No Way Home. After this I don't have any expectations from Marvel films other than Spider-Man.

The humour in this movie is pure cringe. It feels too forced and Awkwafina is completely out of place. The last scene where they sing Hotel California is so damn cringy. It's a tragedy that they thought people would enjoy it. This is a really bad film minus the action sequences. Watch it only for the action which looks good on the big screen. Don't have even the slightest expectation from the story."
FAKE REVIEWS ALL AROUND,"Wow.. Disney has seriously rigged the game here. Noticed most of Disney movies now are full of fake reviews which are written by people of slightly better intellect and a little more fancy than good old one liner fake reviews.. however you can still spot them by their rather generically customized statements.

This was a pretty average movie and could be a 4 but just to counter so many fake reviews I tried to give it 1. It initially gave me error if I selected anything lower than 7.. wow. But after pressing it constantly, it allowed to go lower..

The movie itself is pretty average. Extremely cliche character development and ordinary action."
This is a joke right?,"Honestly some of the worst acting I've ever seen, actually unwatchable. I understand Hollywood has to be diverse but get actors that can do the job! The worst marvel film ever and there has been some right stinkers. Just stop now Disney, it's too much, 4 films a year, 4 series. Save your gd ideas and make one or 2 good films.

Don't waste your time."
Another marvel movie no one's gonna remember,Good in certain moments. And those moments were very few.
"Marvel ruins the Mandarin again (and Shang-Chi, too)",
Fails on Every level (almost),"How has this movie 8.1 rating makes no sense. This movie was super generic. I was expecting something great, but it was worse than Black Widow and that's not easy thing to do."
Somehow even Tenet managed to have more personality,"It's so extremely generic and made with no passion or soul in it. It's just another super generic origin story where main character is basically invincible and beats the bad guy and saves the day, so he could later join some Endgame style movie."
Disney or Marvel?,"This feels like a Disney movie rather than a Marvel movie. And a mediocre one at that. Hopefully this isn't the future of Marvel. The only positive are the fighting scenes. The choreography is truly impressive. But the constant ""awe"" of the fantasy world makes for some bad acting."
Lazy writing,"I was wondering what Marvel/Disney will add to a Kung-fu movie; absolutely nothing, might as well call it shang-chi and last dragon.

Makes no sense at all, plot is very weak, and the movie makes predecessor and successors really problematic after introducing this childish universe that actually wont fit anywhere in the chosen story lines."
Does NOT give a thrill,Flat storyline. Over the top picturing of the creatures. Doesn't feel anything or looks anything attached to Marvel movies at all apart from the loveable Wong. Feels like watching movies made by China production companies that made that Matt Damon The Great Wall movie. Disappointed!
Bad,"Can't tell the tightness and profoundness of Chinese culture at all The title is Shang-Chi, but I don't see where the ""Chi"" is. How to ""Shang-Chi""?

The Chinese ""Chi"" refers to the qi that exercises the qi and blood in the human body, which can be cultivated and practiced by Qigong and other methods

But I really can't see where the ""qi"" in this movie is?"
What a stinker!,Wow what a stinker! Who wanted this movie made? Who are they that this movie was made for? Clearly NOT China as they won't allow it to be shown in their country. Just another boring MCU movie. Probably was worth more than a 1 star but all those 9 and 10 star ratings are undeserved. I'd recommend waiting till this is free on your Disney+ subscription without paying their ridiculous mark up of $30. It's worth waiting for! Definitely NOT worth going to the theater and paying your hard earned money to see it.
Generic,"Not worth watching or wasting your money on it. Some obvious fanboys are trying to hype it up, but it's not that good. If you like actual Martial Arts movies, i would recommend some older stuff from 70s."
"Good Action, Weak Writing",
Shang-Chi = Cha-Ching$$,"Marvel has done it again. And again. And again. This movie is for anyone! Marvel super fans and just good ol' movies fans. It's is one of the coolest origin stories I've ever seen (marvel or non marvel). The fight scenes were some of the best choreographed work you'll see, right up there with civil war and black panther. So awesome to get super powers along side of martial arts. The CGI was so amazing especially at the end. The comedy was perfectly placed. The music/film score was so well put together. It made the movie. Amazing movie. Excited for more! Stay for the mid and end credits. So glad this is proving that MOVIES ARE BACK."
Shang-Chi Review,"Overall very disappointing (as expected) another generic marvel flop. It will obviously make no money, because nobody has never heard of this ""superhero""."
I wished for so much more,"This could have been a great movie, but it wasn't. It began well and ended well. Everything in between was pretty lame. Disney has the Disney plus platform where they could have built up this character since no one really knows who shang chi is. Unfortunately, Disney didn't do that so most of the minute I'm just left wondering why do I care. With so much Asian culture to pull from I wish Disney would have done more. 3 out of 10 stars. Other reviews I'm sure are paid for."
Marvel's Movie Quality is Changing to Nothing More Than A Message Board,
Second Marvel Fail of 2021,Even Mortal Kombat 1995 has better fighting scenes. Not recommending.
Waste of Time,"I was hesitant to watch this because i know how generic marvel movies are, but i was like why not? My mistake i guess, now i just feel like i wasted my money. It was so boring, might as well be streaming movie."
A very big Meh while it could have been soooo much more,"For starters, the cinematography and the CGI are pretty nice. However that's where the positive ends.

The fighting choreography is ok, not bad but not great at all. For example even Mortal Combat did it way better with way less. Also it follows the usual marvel formula of a lot of CGI in the fighting scenes, but this time they blew of the roof with it making those scenes feel completely detached from the world they're in.

Concerning the characters, Shang-Chi isn't really there for most parts of the movie, taking a few steps back in his very own movie. A lot of things that other characters did in their time in the spotlight should have been done by him, there was no reason for him to not do those things. Causing him to be a neglected in his own movie, basically a background character. As for the female leads, one is just plain annoying and really serves no purpose(you'll know instantly when she appears). The other is an over-the-top strong woman actually getting most of the screentime, which don't get me wrong the actress acts nicely, but the way she is presented in the story and the way her character has come to be and is established is just unnatural and feels like she's just someone who has activated IRL-cheats, it just feels like they took a real shortcut with her character whilst there was so much they could've done to make her really likeable and immersable for you as a viewer. However the way they handled her just makes her feel like a 2D cardboard character that used cheats to max her stats.

As for the story and dialogue. The story is just abyssmal, really lacking in content and feels like something a hungover student would drum up last-minute after a late night party. The dialogue feels wooden most of the time, just really unnatural and don't even get me started on the ""humor"" which is overly forced and just really bad.

It feels like a movie that knows what it wants to do, but not how it wants to do that and just goes at it in a dozen ways leaving to much clutter and sidesteps for it to feel like a coherent story. If only they had chosen 1 or 2 things and stuck with them it could have been a decent flick."
Not Marvel ous,"Marvel are in desperate need of good writers!

The story and script are both confusing and beyond cheesey !

It really saddens me as I was once a big Marvelfan but since the passing of Stan Lee and Disney taking over it has produced a lot of trash!

The Marvel I once enjoyed will never be the same it has been turned into yet another Disneyfied production."
Good but could have been great,"If it wasn't for the over use of the Marvel ""comedy"" that they always force into these movies and the terrible CGI, this could have been one of the best Marvel movies yet but Disney seems too stubborn to deviate from the generic formula they use for their movies."
Im Glad Most People Agree Its Bad,"These positive reviews mean nothing, everyone already knows it's bad movie. Most people who leave positive reviews haven't even seen it yet. I actually went and watched it. It's so generic."
Ridiculously Good Action!,"Shang Chi is a completely action-packed movie, from start to end. Sure, the story was predictable with a meek narrative, but those gaps were filled with 2 hours of crazy action. The action sequences and cinematography in itself were quite impressive, considering a good portion of the movie showed sequences without any super powers. Its a good watch!"
Not a single redeemable aspect,"Complete garbage from the get-go. This soulless wreckage of a film is not worth viewing under any circumstances. PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WATCHING THIS. I mean it, especially if you're a Marvel fan. It's disgustingly awful."
"Boring, recycled, charmless, by order propaganda","Have you watched a Marvel action superhero movie before?

What if you've watched, ALL the Marvel superhero movies?

Then you're in for some HOT garbage in this movie, as this was made to order, copying EVERY scene from other Marvel movies.

I mean every fight scene just felt like I'd watched it before, except now the characters doing them I had even less connection with. I'm bored with fights on buses and trains and people leaping around scaffolding. Every Marvel movie has a fight scene on a bus or a train, but this one felt REALLY recycled.

Getting back round to the characters, besides Shang Chi, I can't remember his sisters name, or his weird friends name, who served zero purpose in the movie, accept serving as a loud mouthed joke teller. It was almost as if they wanted a Kevin Hart like star, but had to settle with Awkwafina? And Shang's sister? Just added nothing to the story or the movie. She looked NOTHING like Shang either, or her younger self, the casting was well off there.

Ben Kingsley showing up was amusing, but honestly that was it when it cames to laughs. You could see every joke coming up 30 seconds before it was delivered, because it was a recycled joke from other Marvel superhero movie.

Wong and The Abomination make a cameo appearance in this movie, but their addition is given NO CONTEXT, and makes zero sense, and adds nothing to the movie or their own stories.

Overall, I'd just say every character felt, just like a Chinese copy or a character you've already seen in a Marvel movie before. By the end, I felt like I had watched a propaganda movie made by the CCP. It was like ordering a Chinese, except it came drowned in a bath of Chinese sauce, served on a bed of soggy Chinese mythology. Even the post credit scene wasn't worth sticking around to watch as it contains Marvel's most hated character to ever get a movie in it."
Marvel Disappoints Second Time in a Row,"How incredible sad is to watch Modern Marvel Disappoint Second time in a Row. Obviously it wont even go over 350 Million Worldwide. Boring, generic movie, would have been better as Streaming movie, then some people would at least watch it and maybe react to it on youtube, because that's where most of Suicide Squad popularity came. Wont happen with this movie tho, because nobody can watch it on streaming and nobody cares that much about this movie to go to cinema. Maybe hardcore marvel fans will, but most people wont."
Had it's moments,"Overall it was a pretty bland movie. The plot was uninteresting and boring. There's not as many fight scenes as you'd think. Most of the characters didn't have a lot of personality. And Shang's girlfriend was incredibly annoying.

It had it's moments though. There's a certain character that brought some fun scenes to the film.

It's definitely one of the lower tier marvel movies, but it was still worth watching."
"Yawn...average story, average action",The movie is not well written. The story is below average and the action scenes also not very engaging. Wait for it to come on streaming.
Its boring,"It's seems after Avengers, Marvel has nothing more to show us. Everything about this movie is boring and horrible. It tries to be another Doctor Strange But it failes. Bad comedy, bad acting, bad story...."
Marvel does Disney,"Expected a superhero movie, got a child's Disney flick. Good for anyone 14 and under, otherwise it was pretty bland, boring and cheesy. Looks like Marvel has finally lost their touch.

If you liked Disney's new 'Star Wars' you will like this, otherwise don't bother."
This is an awesome movie! Loved every second of it,"The best amount of tension and humor, with a great storyline and great characters. LOVED IT."
Boring...,"Awful... It was Very disappointed... Actor and Actress are not attractive.

Very childish ~ No more Shangchi ... Please... Or changes Everything and everyone."
Amazing,Such a good movie. The asian representation is on point. If I could give this movie past a 10 star rating I would. Can't wait for what else marvel has in store.
Not a martial artist,Watching this move was like watching a clown act in a circus.
That movie was really bad!,"The story is just not there! The acting was ok, the fighting scenes kinda meh but ok, but the story.. they messed up really bad! Really a bad bad movie from Marvel. Holding hands with Thor 2 and Captain Marvel.. the other reviews were definitely bought."
"Funny as hell, great actors and a good story...","What more do you want!

What more do you want!

A must watch for all ages and especially for those who don't like the typical SuperHero Marvel movies..."
Get your facts right,"Jeff Gordon has the most wins in all of Nascar history? Get your facts right at a minimum at least make it sound like you tried to get it right.

You kept the subtitles up too long, I almost turned it off. You also are trying way to hard with the political stuff not only in this movie but with the new Capt America. Knock it off!!!"
"The extra positive reviews are from ""woke white people"" who don't watch Kung Fu flicks lol","Marvel had a huge opportunity to make this so much bigger and better than just a premise movie.

Beautiful cinematography and the choreography was more than just stunt work. Acting a little rough here and there, the protagonist actor did a pretty good job though. That dry MCU humor we've grown to see didn't quite hit. I know a lot of people wished they would have done much more with Mandarin as he is a pretty big bad in the comics and they hyped him up a lot. But I think this movie just makes people excited for THE NEXT marvel movie rather than truly giving this MCU story life. And with the movie being 2 hours long, it felt so rushed and at the same time most viewers were waiting for it to just end.

And I'll say it, she could be a nice gal but Awkwafina.... I just know I'm not the only one who finds her out of place on screen sometimes. And that's all I will say about that respectfully lol."
Overhyped garbage,"Yet another lame superhero movie. Their decision to really explore into the family conflicts is nice, though the whole thing is still very cliche. There's no personality in the main character beyond that he is Asian. I really hate the score, all of them are garbage asian trap music. It was fairly hard to sit through, the whole 2 hours felt like 2 days. There's no risk nor consequences in the action scenes, they're all really tame. Some lines are extremely corny and the frequent flashback ruined the movie, that also shows how lazy and uncreative Marvel is at storytelling. Spending all their budget at crappy costume, big star actors and special effects while forgetting everything else."
Super-Tokenism,"As a Chinese person living in Australia, watching Shang Chi was an uncomfortable experience. Not unexpectedly, they resorted to the tired tropes of king fu/martial arts and Eastern mysticism as if that is all Chinese culture is about. Unlike Black Panther, where they envisioned a futuristic African kingdom, Shang Chi would not be out of place in 15th-century China. It is exasperatingly unimaginative and reductive. If they were to apply the same treatment to the white heroes of the Marvel universe, we would be watching either a Western or a bunch of heroes/villains who are supremely adept at colonizing new territories, subjugating their local populace and stealing their wealth. Instead of the diversity and inclusivity that they might have intended, this feels more like opportunism/tokenism disguised as benevolence. Disney, do better."
Disneyland Marvel????,"I grew up on Marvel in the 70's, 80's and 90's. Sold my comic book collection and bought a new car and full scuba gear when I was in my 20's. Marvel in the 90's were addressing real life issues such as PCP, HEROIN AND OTHER RELATED ISSUES. Then we had these B-grade comics. Most of the time I didn't even bother reading them because they were so predictable and crap. To waste the money of this magnitude on this Disneyland garbage is an insult to Stan Lee."
Please help!!,
CGI Festival,The plot was averagely old hat and covered ground that has been well trodden before. The film relied far to much on CGI which IMO which detracted from the film. Not the best marvel film.
Mediocre at best,"Just flat and somewhat boring, felt more like a DC TV show then a Marvel film.

Entertaining but just falls down as a Marvel film so many hero's in the Marvel universe why pick this one?!"
The Marvel movie I've been waiting for,"I absolutely loved the first Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy, but since then, most of the movies have just fell flat for me. Shang-Chi on the other hand is exactly what I'd be hoping for. No overly complicated story lines with too many plot holes to count. This has great character development with people you actually feel sympathy for. Natural comedic relief throughout. Amazing fight scenes and fairly constant action without feeling forced. This is just a great super hero movie all around."
Same thing ever,"Nothing innovative or cool, just bunch of pointless visual effects and usual cringe humor of mcu movies."
WOW This Movie Was So Bad,"I was expecting fun Marvel movie, instead i got some random kung-fu movie with superhero i have never heard of. So bad."
MCU widens,One time watch. Too fast of a character transition in 2 weeks even for superhero movies standards. Some nice action scenes. But the one where the father meets the mother takes the limelight. Soul sucker demon was much weaker than what was stated in the movie and final fight ends up real fast. The mcu widens up.
Ahhhm... What??,"Good movie, fun as it has to be a superhero flick. Great martial arts scenes, CGI was pretty decent, good actors and performances. The story wasn't what i was expecting, but you can't put the whole family drama that the main character has in 2 hours. What really bothered me was Awkwafina. WTF? What is she doing in there the whole time? I'm tired of these silly non important characters that ruin everything. She should've stayed in California and disappear. Fun movie tho. Also... DISNEY STOP RUINING OUR GOOD STUFF!!!!!"
First half hour was so cliche,And the fight on the bus so badly done that I turned it off. I now have to write a bunch of drivel to get this review published. Still more required. I apologize if you have to read this.
I have to believe many of these reviews are paid.,"I'd like to write an in depth review but I feel like there's not enough to these movies for that. They just feel like everything else.

If you've seen one of these movies recently you have an idea of what you're in for. If you're into that you'll enjoy it, if you're burnt out on movies feeling the same and characters sounding the same and acting the same and being very the same it will be just another Disney movie in 2021 to kill 2 hours with and get nothing out of.

I've been watching Chinese action stars since I was a child. I'm aware of the main actors comments about not being aware of Chinese heroes before himself somehow because he's done zero research and doesn't enjoy classic cinema in his own time.... and is a 2021 person and wants to just say things, virtue signaling I believe it's called.. but I'd recommend he check some of those movies out instead as they're much more interesting."
Precious ... ten times,"Of course I am just riffing off, teasing and making fun of certain things with my summary line. Though there is some truth in there too - especially if you consider the last third of the movie - quite fantastical, pun intended.

But there is so much more here. And while you may have seen the bus scene already (I imagine many times), it still is quite the highlight and works wonders! Because there is even more to it than the trailer/teaser revealed! As is with the plot and the characters of the movie.

I was able to watch it on an Imax screen and let me tell you ... wow! But also wow and much respect to Marvel and Feige and anyone involved that they dared to make the first ten minutes or so in chinese! And throwing a lot of chinese terms (slang?) in there as well - throughout! That gives it a touch of authenticity. How immigrants in America or anywhere else in the world grew up. I do the same with my Greek and German/English.

It is also nice and while I am prone to be sarcastic, I really think it's a good thing to have such a major and big representation - especially nowadays with Anti-Asian hate/crime rising. All because of people blaming China and people of China for a virus ... the movie does not have that as a topic, it is entertainment after all, but in every promo and interview that the actors were involved it was something that was mentioned. Good for them and good for us, that this was made.

I am a bit biased when it comes to the MCU and this did get a pure theatrical release, instead of the Black Widow treatment (which also was available on Disney plus and the cinemas at the same time). So there is not issue when it comes to that. And if you can watch it on the big screen - you will not be dissapointed! Now waiting for the other stuff to drop ... especially after the mid credit scene, that is such a tease ... the after the credits scene might also hint at something, but the bigger tease was midway through the credits (actually almost at the beginning of them to be honest).

Sit back and enhoy the movie and the really funny characters ... and quite a few familiar faces. Some from the MCU and previous entries but also some from Asian cinema! Well done!"
Not bad,"The opening fight scene is worth the watch, but the cameos steal the show. I won't go in to detail. The Marvel geeks will know what I mean, because there are plenty to count even the hidden ones.

The movie is good and I like the casting. The direction is okay but the cinematography is the best.

The ending is anti climatic. I found it to be cliche. However it is worth the watch. It is nice to see a movie like this and I believe it is a good addition to your watch list."
Must watch movie of this year,Just an another amazing movie brought by MCU with adding a new character to marvel universe. Overall fantastic movie with the point of view of storyline and action sequences which really are one of the best among all marvel movies till now. It is clearly visible by this movie that there's something big planned by MCU in future which would be amazing to watch. At last just watch this movie you will love it.
Perfectly fine,"Action great (except cacophonous dragon fight), acting decent, visuals good, story predictable...the whole this is fine, but I have a more pressing matter to address here. I have yet to watch an MCU movie and felt like I got enough Wong. More Wong. Always more Wong."
A must see movie,"The cinematographie can make this a masterpiece. I just really love the character writing of everyone in this movie , you can easily understand each character because you get to see caused there motivation. And of course the way they used the Chinese language in this movie it fits the movie perfectly and pulls you into the story. Overal a really funny visual pleasing and enjoyable movie."
Visually stunning but overrated,"The fight scenes, creature designs and set are absolutely amazing, but overall story was sort of slow. Visually stunning but yet I couldn't help but feel it's a bit overrated. It also felt less connected to the mcu than most Marvel films and the first Wong/ Abomination cameo felt very out of place."
The perfect start for phase 4,"It is a story of self discovery, full of great character arcs, glorious fight scenes and The cinematography, choreography, plot - it could not have been done better. Simu Liu really shines as the main character: he brings so much charm to the role that it's easy to grow fond of him. CGI and the fight scenes were stunning!

The perfect start for phase 4 (I know, the start is with black widow but is something ""old"")Marvel hasn't made such a masterpiece since Black Panther."
Very Obviously Will Fail at Box Office and For a Good Reason,"It's simply too generic and jokes don't land at all. Not recommending, maybe wait for streaming."
So cringe the whole family left the room,"Wow, this movie is so bad, the kids and wife all slowly left the room to do other things while watching. Katy is so horrible of a character and annoying I was waiting for her character to get offed. Unfunny, bad acting, horrible soundtrack and overall a less than generic steaming pile cranked out by Disney. I would be ashamed to have my name related to this movie in any way. Next time gonna get a root canal instead, would be more fun."
Enjoyable action film,
it is a good movie but not great one,"The cinematography is good. The story is a bit slow, the fighting scenes are great but in the middle of some they just stop and stare at each other or just talk.

Its' not the best mcu film and not close to the best ones.

But it's a good movie to watch in the theaters."
a movie that sucked,
T'was very good.,"I was marveling at this movie.

It was a marvelous.

There was a very funny dance choreography scene.

Children under 17 should not watch, because there is a violence. The characters were not following COVID protocol. So brave, stay strong soldiers."
Very good Family narrative,
Disappointing ending (spoiler warning),
Kung Fu Panda in the MCU?,"This movie is one of the best in the MCU. The story, the characters, the comedy, and especially the action was exceptional. The choreography was stunning and fresh. The characters are relatable and understandable. The Mandarin is one of the best villains in the entire MCU. The mythological aspect was a nice addition to the film, which I personally liked quite a bit. It had everything a superhero film needs. Overall, not too much to complain."
Truely Awesome,It was worth watching and was so fast paced. They need to make the sequel with better story line. Shang-Chi and his friend was truely amazing. The CGI was astonishing and charismatic.
How is this only a 7.5!?!,"I waited a little longer to see this just because it wasn't anything I grew up with. I cannot believe the reviews are this mixed. It's more of a 9/10 but I gotta make up for the idiots. Everything was explained well, it blended action, drama and comedy well. Solid A."
What the point ?,"This is the first marvel movie that I didn't bother go to the cinema for and I'm glad I didn't waste my money.

This is just a greatest hits of all the tropes that the MCU has falling into over the last few years.

to long. I fell asleep twice and had to rewind.


big CGi battle with no real impact.




It's easily the worst marvel movie and they're clearly running out of ideas and characters maybe it's time to just rest the wider MCU then reboot in a few years."
Wow!,"I honestly had no expectations watching this movie because I've never heard of Shang-Chi in any of the Marvel Comics.

Definitely surprisingly fun to watch. Action packed! Definitely recommended!"
Brilliant and thoroughly enjoyable!,"I hadn't heard much in the way of hype regarding this film, and actually found it on Disney+.....which I'm so glad I did!

Visually it's awesome and would've been amazing to see on the big screen (stupid Covid!), but I also loved the characters, storyline and the acting was top notch. Having read some of the negative reviews, I'm actually not sure they watched the same film!? And anyone who watches a marvel film and pans it for being 'far-fetched' should definitely not be given any attention.....'cause the films with the man in the metal flying suit and the big green dude were so realistic! SMH!"
Cool movie,
"Calm down mate, I'm not dead it's just a performance","Another Marvel comics movie. This one takes one of their lesser known characters, martial artist Shang-chi. And gives him a film of his own.

This is not a jumping on point to Marvel movies, as pre knowledge of some other ones will help.

Shang-Chi lives in America. He has a past he thought he left behind. He enjoys karaoke with his best friend (Awkwafina) and he just lives. He has martial arts movie posters on his bedroom wall.

But then his past catches up with him and he is forced to fight. Head across the world. Discover his past. And his destiny...

Like the Black Panther film, this does a good job of showing this world outside of America. It's very stylish in representing it's culture and has some great art direction. It does manage to get a lot of exposition in without being overwhelmed by it, which is not something all comic book movies that have to do that manage.

Awkwafina is quite entertaining playing a character who could easily be very annoying. The first action set piece is terrific, original gripping and really well done.

And all in all, it does succeed by being a little bit different to what has come before.

There is an entertaining surprise as well. Which succeeds in doing some good continuity.

Minor quibbles: it's ten minutes too long. My attention did wander during some of the quieter moments and scenes of people talking. One flashback is a bit extraneous. The character of his sister ends up being rather underused.

And outside of the first set piece I mentioned, they forgot to put any other bits of jeopardy in here. Of the other two set pieces, the first doesn't carry any because you don't believe people are going to get hurt. And the final big battle set piece is yet another of these. We've seen them all many times now, and even though this has some different elements, it's still too same old same old.

But all in all an entertaining watch, and those who like their martial arts movies, or who like to pretend to do such things when watching fight scenes, will be entertained.

Do as ever keep watching to the very end of the closing credits for a couple of extra scenes."
"Strong start, heavily subsided","The first 2/3 of the film are pretty strong. The story is well laid out and the battle scenes look good. The last third of the film is just typical Marvel again, a boring CGI fight in which the brilliantly staged martial arts fights are simply forgotten beforehand.

In addition, I miss the character development of the main character Shang - Chi and the girlfriend of Shang Chi is just a gag relief where most of the jokes do not ignite. I also found the film too predictable.

To stand out is the villain, one of the MCU's strongest villains in my opinion."
More Disney than Marvel...,"Overall, the movie feels more Disney than Marvel with all the fantasy creatures and the tone.

Does not fix the mandarin. The rings don't do much when compared with the ones in the comics.

The villain feels quite generic and discardable, and the end fight does not feel as important or as hard as it should.

Quite a simple movie. Not really much to make it stand out."
We are not kid's anymore,
Shang-Chi and the extremely annoying sidekick/friend katy,
Filler movie with bland characters that tries to be funny but isn't,
"Too safe, far too safe.","The better MCU films feel like they could be a part of our world, with a splash of the fantastic. This film went full fantasy and was way too light hearted and sanitized.

I honestly felt little to nothing for these characters, which is a bit sad for how much Feige was hyping it."
Overrated,I don't get how this flick got such rave reviews. So overrated it's not even funny. I rated this movie at 6 and I think that may even be a bit too generous.
I would give it a 8.5 but I can't also seems like Dc fans are giving bad reviews lol,A solid origin story of marvel's shang chi loved it completely don't know what's wrong with the bad reviews I guess dc fans are super sad that even shang chi over shadowed their only hope this year let's face it the suicide squad is not going to be the best movie this year in fact it's overrated in opinion.
Could not finish it,"Very very bad movie. Its just a martial arts movie where everyone has powers and is special, even the friend of the protagonist in less than 3 days turns into legolas...."
The worst film in mcu,"It was horrible. First of all, the official trailer presented the film in a completely different way. The scenes looked artificial. What bothered me the most were the characters who didn't have to be there at all and didn't fit in there. A completely illogical story... The worst Marvel game I've ever seen."
Can we please stop pretending this marvel trash is good?,"Seriously what are you all smoking?

Poor dialogue, storyline depth of a kids pool, plot armour galore. To those saying this is culturally significant, why?.

Not even worth the review but there is a 150 character minimum."
A typical and overrated Marvel superhero movie,"The whole movie's done on computer. Nothing makes sense. Story is just some fantasy nonsense mixed with pop-culture stuff. Everything is predictable. Everything is cliche. You just can directly skip to the action and you would lose nothing. It's fantasy-CGI fest. Characters are super weak, everyone loses focus or can change its character in a minute.

My god i miss real movies instead of these Marvel superhero things once a month."
One of the greatest MCU productions,"This movie is so amazing, the only issue is the beggening and how we got introduced to everything was a little bet slow. .otherwise, it's a greate production."
Good but not the best,
This movie made me feel like a grumpy old man. And here's why.,"MCU now is in a very strange phase when the universe they've built now is so huge that their movies almost completely stopped working as standalone pieces (aside for a few exceptions like Thor 3).

Shang-Chi brings Asian aesthetics to the table which is kinda new for the universe. And it's done quite well. They've managed to present a whole new world inside the one we've already had at this point throughout this one short movie. They've packed it with alright characters, adventures and action. So as a piece of the bigger narrative this movie is quite well made.

But to me it falls short as a standalone picture. It feels so formulaic at this point that it hurts sometimes. All the twists are obvious from miles ahead. The threat of ""the end of the world"" is so regular at this point that it's impossible to be invested in it and the stakes don't feel significant at all.

And I hate the fact that even a well made movie like this one leaves you feeling empty after watching. It doesn't bring a feeling of completion which I think is one of the most important parts of cinema. Even Wong tells something along these lines in the end: ""It was only a beginning, now you have a very long journey ahead of you"".

I'm for one kinda tired of this never ending journey. And almost want to stop watching anything new from the MCU, so that I don't feel this never ending cliffhanger moment ever again.

Light 7/10 to this movie, big donkey ass/10 to the MCU."
It was ok movie,"Solid pop corn film. Although the director tried not to look like a standard Marvel movie, I think he only succeeded to some extent. The first half of the film was very good, the story, and especially the impressive fight scenes. However, later in the film we constantly get some new elements, the story expands, there is not always an explanation, and the worst part of the film was my last fight because I think they went too far with special effects, for me personally it was not watchable. The bad guys overall were just solid, nothing special. Of course, at the end of the film we have a scene that shows us how to look for (at least) another film."
I would rather....,Be waterboarded for 1 day than watch that train wreck of a pos movie again. The B movie script with marvel money thrown at it......................................
A tale of old...,
Death of Marvel,"Well, that's me done with Marvel films. This was truly awful. Terrible CGI, terrible script, terrible story. Ben Kingsley was the worst. I genuinely hoped they would all die at the end. And I thought Black Widow was bad."
Expensively produced but unoriginal modern Martial Arts film,
Boring.... but Marmite,
Horrible,"Just an 80's kung-fu flick jazzed up for 2021. More reminders of the 'horrible racism"" that exists, because America is the only Country that's had a problem with that...herp derp."
A big thumbs down,"There is no story here, just mindless martial arts gelled with computer graphics, and the movie has some scenes that reminded me of Avatar. Anyhow, Avatar was great, this is not. It is one of the worst Marvel movies. I can go back to rewatching Thor Ragnorok or Endgame and still enjoy them, but not this one."
Typical and Bland (But take it with a grain of salt),"Simply put, this movie was bland. Plot follow a simple acceptance plot, of Shang learning to accept he is his father's son, with no surprising twists or changes to the plot to make it better. Shang himself seems to be watching everything instead of actually interacting with his world. Action scenes were choreographed well, yet never seemed to fit for some reason. The ending was anticlimactic, and I expected more of a ending fight with the big bad. Visually speaking the movie is gorgeous, but i wouldn't watch it for the visuals. Shang as a character is bland and boring. The only character I felt was developed well was Shang's Father. Side characters are forgettable. If you are a fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, then don't watch it as it doesn't fit at all in the timeline, with excessive fantasy elements that don't fit in the universe. Take this review with a grain of salt, as i went into this movie with higher expectations, but these are flaws i saw as i watched the film. Thank you for your time."
A great Kung-Fu movie.,
Generic,This movie sucks. Generic predictable flat but mostly funky you disney.
It's a fun MCU ride with some hidden ingredients to make it stand out,
Good - but still underwhelming.,
Top MCU film,"Does everything the MCU does very well, a few of the things it does poorly, and then brings a whole lot of new elements to the universe. Incredibly enjoyable ride in theaters. At worse, you'll leave feeling like it was pretty good."
Generic marvel movie that could have delivered so much more,"This had so much potential that got sadly wasted.

The few fight scenes in the first half were better in quality compared to the usual Marvel quick cut edited ones. They were mildly reminiscent of the Matrix fights( The intro to the Shangchi theme music even sounded suspiciously similar to Furious Angels from Matrix Reloaded and made me miss the Matrix films more)

However, anything positive about the film ends in the first half only with the second half culminating in a bloated CGI mess that is the hallmark of almost all Marvel movies. In fact, between Shangchi and Black Widow, I'd say the latter featured much better visual effects which would have looked better on the big screen than this. Shangchi would have been a more apt as a direct to video release.)

It didn't also help that the lead actor was a complete void of charisma.

Honestly, I am just going to watch some Jackie Chan movies now to now to help deal with the kung fu cravings this movie initiated in me but failed to deliver."
Very boring film only shows china greatness,Marvel tries to show only greatness of china. And half of the movie doesn't have any action very boaring movie. Total waste of time. No comparison with dr strange movie and Ironman movie. This is (minus)-10 star movie.
Great visuals and fight scenes,
hell yeah,"Amazing martial arts and epic fights, but it lacks plot in the ending and it's quite bland. Still it's one of the best hand to hand combat MCU-movies I've seen. Good usage of comedy as usual for the MCU."
This is the marvel movie the year wanted,Okay so I know black widow was good and all but this oh my God this is the marvel magic movie of the year I laughed felt a rush of action and adventure threw out the entire movie it's just flat out fun to watch like every marvel movie should be so much fun so much to enjoy i highly recommend it to almost anyone. So much enjoyment here.
You're missing out on a outstanding film if you're thinking of not seeing it,"I left the theater almost speechless, I went in with pretty high expectations, As a Asian-American person I didn't really know what to expect from the MCU since it was really their first time introducing this type of culture and character into their franchise, but after seeing this it met all my expectations from the cinematography, to the lore of Chinese mythology and action. I hope this film gets the hype it deserves it ties in with the bigger MCU and leaves some mystery for the anticipation of more."
Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,
VISUAL MASTERPIECE !,
A good action *marvel* movie,"What I like :

1)the action, especially in the first half and the building scene that make me nervous and scared on the characters

2) great visuals and good cinematography, colors, cgi was really amazing

3)I love the acting

4) a good villan that really do everything for a purpose not because he is the bad guy so he acts like that (like the villan of ""black widow"" movie)

Now, what I don't like

1)like every marvel movie the movie begins strong and introduce the characters then it becomes more slow with good comedy and some action and we go to a journey to the final battle full of cgi fights, OK guys there are some people who love cgi fights but not me, the fight was a bit terrible and predictable (honestly I love the action in this movie but not the final battle)

2) the movie is full of emotional scenes but (do I feel anything? No)

3) the music was good but not epic and there is no great theme for shang chi (I loved the music and the songs but it wasn't good enough)

Overall good action movie with a great action sequences and good comedy and good villan and cinematography and cgi, but it's a *marvel* movie, with cgi final battle and weak ending and a good setup for what comes next

Thank you for reading my quick review, this is my opinion, the more important is your opinion and remember not everyone one love the same thing."
Painfuly bad,"If this movie's reviews are legit, then there is no hope left for humanity.

Poor script, no substance, overlydramatic for no reason, a ridiculous mix of US comedy and Chinese action.

Could only take 48 min of it and i gave up."
Shang Chi is a Emotional Roller Coaster,"Shang Chi is an emotional roller coaster. Using the strength of its powerful and interesting villain, the movie successfully brings together the past 10 years of Marvel movies into a largely effective cocktail of super-heroic dramatics. Destin Daniel Cretton creates a superhero movie that it's every bit the epic that it needs to be. However prepared you feel, you are not ready for the villain, Mandarin . Shang Chi is stunning, hilarious and heartbreaking and one of the best action set pieces of this year which is the bus scene."
Did they really spend money in this movie?,
Huge disappointment,"Not sure what the hype was. Story, script, acting were all third class. Story also a disrespect to the Chinese culture and society. The fightings were good so that's the 3 stars. Left at 50th minutes. Super disappointed with Marvel."
Just no,"Who keeps giving these latest MCU projects such high rating? Fanboys with low expectations, or the people who work for Disney that need to países this garbage in order to keep their jobs?"
Disappointed,"Bad acting, boring story and incredibly cheesy. I didn't bother watching it all. The random woman that's in it throughout is purely irritating. Honestly don't waste your time and don't trust its 7 star rating. I'd rather watch banana man. Complete rubish."
MCU and funny,"Shaun (Simu Liu) and Katy (Awkwafina) are slackers in San Francisco. Well, they're Chinese slackers which means that they still have jobs. They're just dead-end jobs. Unbeknownst to Katy, Shaun's real name is Shang-Chi and he was trained from childhood to fight by his father Xu Wenwu (Tony Chiu-Wai Leung) who has been conquering for a thousand years with the Ten Rings until he met the love of his life, Shang-Chi's mother.

This is MCU doing an Asian hero and it's actually pretty funny. Awkwafina does her comedic thing. Simu Liu does a good every-man performance but he's also a good straight man to Awkwafina. I like the pairing although they may be better as friends. Then the movie surprises with a comedic turn from Ben Kingsley. I love that part which gave the movie a comedic jolt. I wouldn't mind him popping up in other MCU stuff. The dragon fight is a little blah but those climatic battles are getting standardized anyways. This is a fine addition to the MCU and these are fun characters to add to the gang."
"if you're looking for a boring movie, this is it","Too kuch talking. Less action. By far the worst marvel movie in my life, and I've lived long enough. Very typically-chinese-based-movie. (I'm talking about the amount of cgi it the movie. 90% cgi, 7% talking and 3% action. However, it is angreat movie for your kids who doesn't understand anything or who haven't learn to talk."
First 10 minutes were ok.,"I was hooked within the first 10 minutes of the move, and then it turned american hollywood way too fast and became a 1 star movie. I could not even finish the last 20 minutes of the movie it was so bad. They introduced horrible actors with horrible dialog that just made the movie dumb and worthless.

I gave this movie 2 stars only because of the first 10 minutes were ok.

I'd really like to get at the root of the problem of the recent bad movie epidemic coming out of hollywood that's been going on for about the last 5 years. WHAT GIVES!?"
Just another 'Cultural misunderstanding',"As a Chinese audience I feel awkward and weird,then I realized this movie is totally not for me ,it's for westerners, so I quit and left.

By the way I hate Kung Fu Panda ,too. Panda looks so ugly in it."
Unique Marvel film is a blast!,"Having worked on this film's visual effects, I can safely say that I was pleasantly surprised when watching Shang-Chi at the premiere. Up to that point, I had not actually watched the full film.

This movie is bolstered by a fantastic performance from Simu Liu, who I hope will star in many other great films. His charisma alone is a good reason to like the movie. The supporting performances weren't quite as memorable, but of course, they were not bad at all. As usual, the visual effects for this film were great (and I might be a tad too self-indulgent here), as was the direction by Destin Daniel Cretton.

I am very excited to see where Shang-Chi will show up next!"
Awesome movie! Highly reccomend,"Made an account just to write this review. By far one of the best MCU movies so far. Amazing action, cinematography, and acting, combined with one of the best origin stories in recent superhero cinema.

GO WATCH IT!!! You won't regret it."
Could have been better,Quite a lot of representation and it is great that they are trying to expand Marvel's repetoire. Main character could have been casted a little better.
Better than expected,"I didn't know anything about the film before going to see it, I thought it would be like Dr Strange (it wasn't). Beautiful visuals, brilliant action scenes and I was interested in the film the whole time!"
"Loved the first half more, watch it for Tony Leung's villain","Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is an entertaining albeit formulaic popcorn Marvel film that's part-family drama and part-kung fu adventure that is raised by Tony Leung's villainous performance as Wenwu. It delivers a solid introduction to an Asian American superhero while paying tribute to Chinese martial arts films.

First off, it's very pleasing to see the warm reception Shang-Chi has received across the world. It's a phenomenon to see English-speaking audiences intensely cheering for a subtitled film that has large portions in Mandarin. Back in my university days, the average Western filmgoer typically would not see a foreign subtitled movie on the account of not wanting ""to read a movie."" Look at how much the world has changed now.

The first half of Shang-Chi plays much stronger. The San Francisco bus sequence is reminiscent of a Hollywood big-budgeted version of 90's Jackie Chan films set in Western locales, like Rumble in the Bronx, Who Am I or First Strike.

The fight choreography moves from hard fisticuffs towards fantastical wuxia, and plunges into more and more CGI. The former is more engaging with Shang-Chi being caught in the wrong place at the wrong time in a real setting.

Simu Liu does a solid job as Shang-Chi and has impressive moves. Like an athlete, he sells the hits and moves swiftly when performing parkour. Liu grew on me throughout the movie, much to the aid of the always-charismatic Awkwafina as his best friend Katy. They share a charming banter as if they were doubling as their own R2-D2 and C-3PO.

The film's MVP is Tony Leung, who approaches his role with an award-worthy intensity, injecting a depth and gravitas to his villain that elevates the film to another level.

I was amazed by the depth Leung achieved through his scenes. The scene that struck me was a flashback where Tony Leung's Wenwu comes home through his door and gives a look of concern to his own family. In that one glance, Leung portrays a completely different person in contrast to the villain in the present. His performance cut right through me and I felt I was watching someone suffer.

It is unfortunate as Wenwu is undercut by the script introducing a second villain late in the second half, which diminishes Leung's character. Wenwu is established as an immortal who's fought for power through the ages, yet there's a lack of wisdom in his latter actions that felt unconvincing.

Shang-Chi's third act takes a strange turn into mythic realms and loses the gravitas that was promised in the first act. The story shifts into a westerner's stereotypical view of China. We get the straw hats, the rice paddy village that looks Cambodian, and the constant mention of dragons. With a CGI-infused finale spectacle, the movie then exhausts all the good will earned from the first half.

Shang-Chi is entertaining Marvel fare that will be remembered best as a cultural zeitgeist icon for Asian American representation. However, as a film, I don't feel the need to revisit it anytime soon. When I will, it will be for the San Francisco section and Tony Leung scenes.

I am Asian, not Asian American. I'm happy for other Asian Americans who feel represented by Shang-Chi. I personally do not feel that representation from this film and am fine with that. Looking at the film itself, I admit Shang-Chi is one great step in the Asian American representation fight. However, it's apparent there's still a heck of a long way to go..."
A Master Marvel Movie,The Plot of Shang-Chi is extremely entertaining with twists and turns. The World-building is spectacular. The Characters are extremely well written with depth unlike most marvel movies. A must watch for Marvel fans.
"Poetry in motion, layered story, emotional adventure. A sparkling jewel.","Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is a wonderful movie in so numerous ways... Visually striking, with a great mastery of the staging from beginning to end.

So much visual poetry, the legend/adventure aspect of it is really top-notch, with legends & mystical elements that grab you ever more with the story unveiling before your eyes ... The humor is very pleasant (Katy, played by Awkwafina, brought a welcome energy & heart in each of her scenes) and adds a pretty pleasant flavor to the whole adventure.

I really loved the way the characters are written, with Xu Wenwu (Tony Leung) as a complex & layered figure all along the movie... And Xialing (Shang-Chi's sister, played by Meng'er Zhang), as well as Li (their mother) are both highly enjoyable to see express themselves on-screen, they both have a lot of presence (and skills), each in their own ways.

I found the entire movie very coherent, every detail makes sense and is counter balanced in a way or another... Yes, there is a strong notion of balance (darkness & light, and so on), with a lot of messages infused in both the action & dialogs. It is an extremely entertaining movie, but I really wanted to emphasize the richness and depth of its story/mythology and characters, all connected in the most organic way.

By the way, I loved the whole Asian/Chinesz myths & legends aspec of the movie, the spirit & philosophy of it all was a true delight to my eyes, with countless Sci-Fi elements entwined in it, but all smoothly integrant of this mythology... I think I probably put it in my Top 5 Marvel movies... I found the staging really majestic, from the dialog scenes to the action scenes, the humor, the flashbacks, and this new ""universe"" (mythology) that is presented here, it just all flows in such a delightful way from beginning to end.

Marvel Studios always are very very clever at hiring a great variety of talents, and they nailed it once again... Destin Daniel Cretton (the director of the movie) is super creative and manages to construct pretty complex scenes while always masterfully telling a story, building a deeply cohesive piece ; it's all fantasy but nonetheless feels visceral and real. This movie is another Marvel movie you often forget that it is a Marvel movie, precisely because of its powerful and so deeply captivating mythology, and this emotional weight that you can feel over the characters, it truly sets something different. It felt like I was watching a movie in the vein of certain epic Asian adventure/martial arts movies... Gotta admit it's my jam, so... In addition to the Marvel stuff, it's a very pleasant feeling.

The energy in the movie theater was fun, lots of people were excited from all these scenes that just grab you. Because yes, clearly... There is a good number of mind-blowing scenes in this incredible movie ! The photography and color treatment make the movie very striking... And like I said, certain scenes mesmerize you because of their beauty & mastery, or even their grand epicness ! At times, it feels like an epic fresco that you are contemplating.

The scene when/where the two parents meet for the first time is beyond gorgeous (the setting, the colors, the choreography, the costume design and overall design, the music & sound effects, the characters and the atmosphere as a whole) ; an absolute masterpiece of art, visually way beyond sublime, what a gift for the eyes, wow... And the 'Grand Final' is quite simply epic, emotionally grabbing, and of course stunning visually, with a flow of glorious shots that all are impressive.

A jewel."
Marvel again outlived our expectations!!!,"It's one of the best marvel/origin movies to date. Can't wait for what's next. It was action-packed, hilarious, and emotional. Family at its heart/core. The story was EPIC, visuals were great. It redeemed Iron Man 3 and Ten Rings. Wenwu was amazing, one of the best and memorable Marvel villains. Simu Liu shined as Shang-Chi, it was made for him. His portrayal made Shang-Chi an instant fan favorite. Co-stars were also amazing, they portrayed their roles perfectly. Especially, Xialing and Katy, such great characters. A must-watch."
A Blatant Cash Grab,"The fight scenes were passable but the plot was incoherent nonsense. The dialogue was hammy and clichéd throughout. The whole thing was a naked, cynical cash grab pandering to the Chinese market and nothing more than that."
Effectively nothing new,"SHANG-CHI AND THE LEGEND OF THE TEN RINGS is being called ""the Asian BLACK PANTHER,"" and I think this is an inaccurate description for two reasons. First, Asian cultures have been explored in-depth by Hollywood since the 1970s at the latest, and in ways that sub-Saharan African cultures have not. But second, and more to the point, SHANG-CHI is really just a mashup of two Hollywood subgenres that have been around for quite some time: the ""ethnic discovery"" film and the ""stupid American tourist"" film.

The ""ethnic discovery"" film is the more recent type and by far the more interesting, ultimately inspired by Alex Haley's famous TV miniseries ""Roots."" It documents the saga of a protagonist who learns - or relearns - about his or her heritage and embarks on a quest to fully embrace that heritage. A good example I can think of is THUNDERHEART, in which an FBI agent (Val Kilmer) comes to appreciate his father's Native American ancestry while on a case on a Lakota reservation; a more famous but fantasy-based example is STAR WARS, in which Luke Skywalker learns that he has Jedi blood. On the surface, SHANG-CHI definitely follows this pattern.

Unfortunately, the movie's ""ethnic discovery"" theme is undercut by the clichés of an even older Hollywood storyline: what one film historian has dubbed the ""racial adventure film,"" but which I simply call the ""stupid American tourist film."" Common since the 1930s, this film plot follows Western (and almost always white) characters as they visit an ""exotic"" foreign land - often for purely exploitative purposes - and proceed to reveal their ignorance about the ""native"" culture. It has always been demeaning to both the ""colonizing"" and indigenous peoples, since the former are forced to make buffoons of themselves and the latter must bear the humiliation of not being taken seriously.

SHANG-CHI is an ""ethnic rediscovery"" film in that two Chinese-Americans from San Francisco learn (and, in one case, relearn) about the culture of their ancestors; but it is also a racial adventure film in that they are essentially Westerners who travel to China and find themselves in the midst of a culture clash. While not white - and, in the case of the titular character, an immigrant - Shang-Chi and his girlfriend otherwise fit the role of the ""stupid American tourist"" with their unmistakably American accents, annoying use of slang, pointless pop-culture references, and wisecracking sarcasm. The twist here is that, like Kilmer in THUNDERHEART, they revert to their ""noble savage"" origins once they have traveled to an ""ethnic"" place and ""gone native.""

Not incidentally, there's one more way in which SHANG-CHI AND THE LEGEND OF THE TEN RINGS differs dramatically from BLACK PANTHER. While both are based on ""non-Western"" comic book sagas created by white men, BLACK PANTHER turns stereotypes about black Africans completely inside-out, giving us fantastic science fiction instead of hackneyed ""jungle"" adventure. But SHANG-CHI is just the usual ""kung pow"" hash about the Orient, presented ironically but also in a way that isn't terribly original.

In fact, if there's another Marvel movie this one closely resembles, it's not BLACK PANTHER but DEADPOOL. Both combine wacky humor and serious (and even ""dark"") subject matter in a way that's very jarring and ultimately exasperating. But at least DEADPOOL felt fresh."
A disappointment: predictable and shallow,"The movie's CGI and action sequences were top tier, but the story and writing, the most important parts of a film, were predictable and simplistic.

Character motives were shallow and stereotypical and I was not emotionally invested in the family or any individual character. Once you understand that the movie is about family, which you can pick up right away, the plot, conflicts, and resolution are entirely predictable.

The movie had its classic Marvel funny moments (diffusing tense moments with surprising humor), but I cringed in plenty of scenes too. This movie had a poor ending with little emotional catharsis. The ultimate conflict was resolved with CGI, magic, and deus ex machinas, like the average action blockbuster, which might have been acceptable if it had emotional depth or moral complexity, but it didn't.

Overall, the movie was a typical superhero film about family bonds with Kung Fu and dragons. As much as I love the Chinese representation, as I am Chinese, the movie itself was disappointing."
"Computerized Atmosphere, Dull Story and Characters, A Few Good Parts","Awkwafina should not be the most interesting part of your $150 million kung fu movie.

She wasn't great (sometimes she was a bit annoying, to be honest), but everyone else was forgettable. Shang-Chi himself was the generic ""slacker with potential"" character with no personality. And he was a live wire compared to the rest of the cast. Aside from Awkwafina, the others seemed to have picked one emotion (either stoic, angry, stern, or ""wise"") and stuck with it.

Wait a minute, I forgot about Ben Kingsley. His appearance was a nice surprise (I think), but he was a wacky Disney animated movie sidekick with an awful-looking CGI pet monster (who was also a wacky Disney animated movie sidekick).

Shang-Chi strikes me as an American-friendly martial arts movie. Not that I'm an expert on kung fu movies, but I've watched enough movies (including several Marvel movies) to know a factory-made action flick when I see it. The movie is very watered down.

There was, for instance, no effort involved in developing a plot or telling a story whatsoever. It's almost the exact same plot as the CW's Kung Fu series. Family vs. Family.

I wanted to enjoy the fight scenes (I can tell that a lot of effort was put into them), but everything looked fake. Obvious special effects mixed with artificial movie sets. The final battle was two giant cartoons wrestling each other.

As a matter of fact, almost every scene in the movie was covered in computer graphics.

I didn't hate the movie. I can see other people liking it. But I was bored most of the time."
Worth watching,Although i watched hall print bt this movie was too good that i can't even blame the hall print.
"The ""No"" movie","No start, no middle, no end, no goodie, no baddie, no love interest, no tension, no shocks, no message, no mystery, no point."
Shang-Chi review,Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is one of the best comic book movies I've seen! Great humor and intense action throughout the film! You can sympathize with the villain! The music is phenomenal (possible MCU best). Go watch it!
So much better than I expected,
The Best Origin Story Marvel has produced yet.,"Some of the best action scenes yet, great backstory and character development, one of the best MCU ""Villians"" yet, overall very refreshing and enjoyable."
Bus Boy,
Not a good movie,"This movie was a fist in the face or rather a razor fist. I don't know if the movie is bad or I can't watch Marvel movies anymore but I didn't like anything about this movie, neither the story, nor the special effects, nor the acting. It all seemed too exaggerated and predictable, plus two hours is really too much for a movie of this type.

The only interesting parts were the first minutes where you see the meeting between the parents and the clash between the abomination and the monk whose name I don't remember.

I think instead the worst part was the final battle, even the too long and exaggerated one."
A cheesy and fake Chinese culture movie,"The worst Marvel movie ever, or even the worst movie I ever watched. A Chinese culture movie showing no respect to Chinese culture lol. Another solid proof that Hollywood doesn't have the capability for a good movie with Chimes elements. A mixed-up with all kinds of cheesy plots and poor imitations from other movies. I bet Marvel only spent 1/10 budgets of Spiderman3 on this one. A total waste of time!!!"
How many times do I have to watch the same thing ?,How many times will people see the same plot in marvel movies and rate it 10 stars ? I can understand the action was good ( bot great ) but it does not make up fir the storyline.
Popcorn anyone?,"A movie which you have to watch with your brain switched off. If you are someone who looks for a half-decent plot and storyline, don't waste your time!!

There is only one Marvel movie which is worse-the crap known as Iron Man 3-which is why it's not surprising there is a link between it and this train wreck."
A film let down by feminist moralising,"This film would have been so much better if they didn't constantly carry on about how much better women are than men.

I cannot give examples without spoilers.

Hollyweird must ruin everything they touch."
5/10,"Waited to watch this for no extra cost on Disney+. Kind of a chore to sit through, way too much CGI to engage you (might as well watch Raya if I'm in the mood for that). Akawafina and Kingley let me awake."
the ten rings that do nothing.,"So finally today it arrived on Disney plus and before work I thought I will give a watch and see if it is that bad and yes it is.

This is the to be honest the woke generation and also the generation a lot more racism, this film has a lot of it and stupid dialogue that makes no sense I don't understand with movies like this the audience is insulted by the moving continuing to tell us that is a Asian film about Asian people. We get it so why?

Anyway the movie has some ok fight scenes but some of the camera work ruins going all around high low and it just makes look bad. Abomination looks horrible a real down grade in CGI. For the me ten rings do nothing for the main character or his father there is nothing special about them they can both fight without the use of them.

The last hour of the film drags so much and is filled with CGI and is complete over the top not in a good way this movie feels completely rushed and because of covid they must have thought they had to but that is no excise the movie suffered greatly.

Overall the downfall of marvel continues."
This movie sucks,"Is this marvel? Or a really bad computer game. Acting was not great, camera work was all over the place. My girlfriend liked the fluffy animals and fight choreography (more like dancing).... I think I now may have brain damage."
Yawn,This movie was horrible. Save your time & money. Marvel must have been desperate. I don't even know what they were thinking. Then you bring the guy that played Mandarin lol so sad.
New legend!!,"An Absolut entertainment. Funny, emotional, action packed. Acting is good direction editing very very good, other techniqualities are good... al last a powerful origin story."
Marvel's Visual spectacular,"Still can't get over the movie even after watching it for two times in two days.

Didn't want to miss this in theatres as this is releasing after two years. One of the best Marvel movie out there."
Blew away my already high expectations,"I had very high expectations and Shang-Chi still blew me away. Definitely the best Marvel movie to date, the story was great. The villain wasn't boring and didn't have lame motives, the characters were well written, the music was fantastic and the fight scenes and special effects were amazing. It's also a very easy movie to understand and enjoy if you aren't very well versed in Marvel movies as it's Shang-Chi's introductory movie. Highly recommend."
"With Shang-Chi, Marvel presents their first Asian superhero in a good and cultural way.","Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is a new superhero movie in the Marvel film series. The film is directed and written in part by Destin Daniel Cretton, the director of Short Term 12 and Just Mercy.

The film is about Shaun (Simu Liu), who tries to put his past behind him and just wants to enjoy his life with his best friend Katy (Awkwafina). When the mysterious organization the Ten Rings finds Shaun, he is forced to confront his past after all. To do this, he must take his birth name Shang-Chi again, to protect Katy and his sister Xialing (Meng'er Zhang) from the actions of the Ten Rings and their leader Xu WenWu the Mandarin (Tony Chiu-Wai Leung) who is also Shaun. His father.

This film is Marvel's first superhero film starring an Asian actor. Furthermore, with this film they also bring out the Asian culture and fighting styles well. For this they have used other movies like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon as an example. Fans of this film can recognize moments that refer back to these films. They portray the fight scenes where characters fight each other with Asian fighting styles well and entertainingly. The art of the Asian fighting style is somewhat overshadowed when characters use more supernatural powers in the film. Fight scenes where this happens are less exciting and entertaining than scenes where characters fight each other in more normal ways.

At one point, the film also feels like you're watching a live-action mix of the Asian animation shows Pokémon and Avatar: The Last Airbender. These scenes provide some extra comedy and are especially more entertaining for younger viewers. The movies and costumes of the film cast also help with the emergence of Asian culture in the film. The visual effects are also put to good use in the film. Except for a few scenes, it can be seen that they have used a green screen for the background, but fortunately this is not disturbing in the film. Creatures can also be returned before the start of the film. A bit redundant on a few action scenes with 3D effects in the film.

The acting is well done by the film cast. Simu Liu took to Twitter to ask Marvel to play the part, with both parties quickly making a good deal. Simu Liu comes across as good and charismatic as the lead of the film and further conveys the action sequences beautifully. Along with Awkwafina, he also has good chemistry in the film and together provide good appropriate humor. The comedy also doesn't overshadow all the dramatic aspects in the film, which sometimes does happen. Tony Chiu-Wai Leung also portrays the villain of the film in a good and sympathetic way, so that as a viewer you understand why he does what he is doing to me. This film is also only his first English-language role in an American film. Although this is only his first time, he still delivers good and appropriate acting. Meng'er Zhang does not get that much time in the film, but a bit less good or present in the film."
Wow!,This movie surprised me in a good way! I was expecting it to be a flop but it was honestly GREAT! The action and storyline all together made it! Marvel did a really good job with this one and met all expectations.
Great movie. FUTURE OF THE MCU,Great movie with awesome acting and stunts. Good jokes throughout the movie aswell. The story was awesome and im definitely looking forward to the future of the MCU.
People are going a tad bit Crazy with the Praise !!!,"First of all, I think People are overhyping this film a bit like they did Black Panther. Is this the Best MCU Origin Film Ever ?? Hell No !! There are atleast 3 better origin stories existing. But there's a lot of good things Shang-Chi does that differentiates this film from the normal MCU film. The Visuals are breathtakingly beautiful and unlike any MCU film I have seen. The tone of the film resembles Chinese Action Movies more rather than MCU which is so refreshing. The first few fight scenes are just incredible and got me super hyped but the quality falls in the later scenes when it becomes a CGI Monsterfest. The story is very predictable and full of narration and exposition. At its core its a very emotional family drama but the dialogues are not powerful enough to dig really deep and I craved for that in so many scenes. The performances are solid with Awkwafina and Ben Kingsley providing great Comedic Relief, but the standout is Tony Leung. He generates such level of empathy and emotional suffering with just his eyes, He is the Legend after all. Overall its a really fun watch, but not as great as people are shouting it is."
Nothing original,"It feels like a mash up of about 10 old movies anc 20 plots weaved into one film, for me I didn't enjoy it very much, there were positives but overall I didn't leave feeling like I'd seen something that special. It didn't feel like a marvel film, I'm not against diversity or going in different directions but it just wasn't a film I loved or would see again. The characters were bland and uninspiring, the humour was ok but bit same old same old and the plot which I'd guess you'd call the main theme felt a bit daft.

The cgi was awesome, graphics, choreography and costumes all really nice, parts were genuinely beautiful but if the film ain't doing much for me that doesn't matter.

Think a lot would hinge on whether you got this gimmick or liked it, I didn't, they were cool for set pieces and what they wanted to achieve in the movie but I just felt they weren't something I thought was interesting or that impressive.

It was always going one way, it was pretty predictable and I didn't feel or believe the emotion as I found the story a bit stupid, it just felt directionless and they were trying to do so much whilst achieving very little.

It felt long to, much longer than the run time, it just wasn't a film I'd recommend and it was one I felt disappointed.

I maybe backwards though as everyone's saying this makes up for black widow, I don't get that, I thought black widow was brilliant. Way better than this.

Also it seems if it's Asian and a bit funny everyone calls awkwafina."
An awesome fresh start to the MCU,"This movie was awesome. It felt like an entirely different experience with amazing CGI. Tony Leung really shone in this movie. It definitely focuses on introducing new characters unlike what people think that these solo mcu movies are just there to set up for a must see event.

I just don't understand why people are rating this one star when it hasn't even been released in the majority of countries. People just be hating for no reason."
You're a Wizard Chang,"Some reviews act like it's new coming of martial arts cinema or something, but no. It's just harry potter who does kung fu. Very generic and predictable."
"Unlike most superhero movies, I tolerated this one...","As with all Marvel movies, the ending tries so hard to be enormous that it becomes visually impossible to comprehend. I would like it if just one of these superhero movies had a character think and talk their way out of a threat to humanity. Nevertheless, this is one of the better attempts... Primarily because it is a well acted origin story with a minimal amount of heart and soul. Be thankful for small mercies!"
A Disservice to Asian Americans and Insult to Asian Culture,"This movie is an awful money grab from Marvel that takes advantage of the typical stereotypes against Asians.

The movie presents itself like some white knight movie that advances the portrayal of Asians in cinema, when in reality it does the exact opposite by heavily utilizing the exact same set of stereotypes and motifs in the film.

This movie should not have been called progress for Asians in cinema, but rather an insult to the Asian culture."
"Boring, confusing and not enough Shang-Chi","Imagine if in Hobbs and Shaw, Hattie did all the work and was the primary driving force, take away the comedy and just make it more or less boring and you've got your film. I don't wanna be harsh but this is trash; maybe it's a poor quality script, lack of practice, super hero presence or aesthetic.

What's wrong with marvel these days? Since Daredevil writing/productions been going south."
Watch if your 10 or under,Marvel movies have truly just become child's movies very predictable and boring storing with such mediocre writing. It is truly a joke to call something like this 'cinema'
I was very embarrassed to watch this film as Asian,"I understand how diversity is important and it seems like one of such thoughts in this film.

But no, I felt so strange to watch this film the last night, somehow I was ashamed and embarrassed with the story and all about this film.

Respect the diversity, understand how Chinese market is important for Hollywood today, but please keep some balances and make more natural films."
Best of all realms,"A dazzling visual and special effects phenomenon that brought acting, fight scenes and story telling together to bring us one of the top Marvel movies to the deserved Big Screen. I wanted this to be great and it exceeded my expectations, well done by all involved. Kevin Feige's super power must be to bring people together and letting do their their story without controlling every aspect of the production."
WOW,"Amazing film, setting up Phase 4 Marvel beautifully! Can't wait to see what happens next."
Definitely one of the best marvel films so far,"The action in this film is on another level, The cinematography is new propaply the best among all marvel films.

The last battle didn't really satisfy me but I enjoyed this film unlike many others, I hope that marvel keeps it up."
My favorite Marvel movie so far!,"For a guy like me, that grown up watching Jackie Chan's kung fu movies, this film was a wonderful experience!

Besides all the perfect fight scenes and amazing special effects the story telling was terrific, I was completely moved by Shang-Chi's story and his family's.

And the ending was awesome as well! I don't have too much to say, just a wonderful feeling that this movie gave me!"
Actually Quite Lame,This has to be a test. Anyone that is praising this movie either has the intelligence of a 12 year old or is a complete slappie shill. The movie isn't offensively bad but it plays like it was written by a child. Silly and shallow. A far cry from epic Marvel.
Kung Fu Romp with Lame Story,"Its your typical high flying kung fu action script layered on top of an uninteresting story with no depth.

The main character and his sidekick were tiring to watch because they are adults acting like teens. They never managed to become interesting. The acting however was fine so its not a knock on the actors themselves but the script was kiddie. They were clearly going for the teen demographic with this movie.

I personally couldnt enjoy it. Marvel in general, hasnt really produced a film that I enjoyed in a very long time so its not really surprising. This might be fun if you are younger but for adults who have seen or read a lot of stories, this is probably not good."
Too much bad CGI,"Way too much bad CGI, terrible writing, and an average storyline in this movie. I was excited to watch this movie only to see that the hype was more than what the movie delivered. The last two MCU films just haven't been the greatest. Kind of disappointing actually."
More of the same,"The major concepts in this film are genuinely interesting, but they are ruined by several problems that have become a norm for MCU films at this point. The major things being that they commercialize it so much to a point where all of the significantly new and interesting ideas are made boring and bland. What I can say is that the choreography is genuinely excellent. Overall it was fine but it didn't make me feel anything really."
"This is phase 4 guys, majestic !!","This movie is it, the whole time I was in awe, everybody in the theater were. Don't read anything, watch it, it's worth the time and money and everything. Marvel outdid themselves. This is phase 4 people, this is it.

Fantastic directing, fantastic editing, fantastic CG, fantastic soundtrack. My expectations were surpassed. I recommend it to everyone."
Amazing,"Love the cinematography, the plot, the cast, the whole idea of this movie is amazing. 100% recommend."
Stunningly Beautiful in every way.,"Destin Daniel Cretton, who mentored who mentored two academy award winners, Brie Larson and Rami Malek and another Academy Award nominee, Lakieth Stanfield has demonstrated he has no limitations. Two years in the making Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings delivers on every cylinder and it has at least 16.

You will find yourself laughing out loud a lot! You will be dazzled by the remarkable beauty and you will be transfixed by the fight scenes. Especially the ones between Shang Chi's, (Simu Liu) mother, Jiang Li (Fala Chen) and his father, Wen Wu (Tony Leung) stunningly beautiful choreography, his sister,Xiangling (Meng'er Zhang) and finally, the one between his aunt. Jiang Nan (Michell Yeoh).

The runaway bus is funny, brilliant, and exciting.

The story is engaging, multi layered and satisfying in every way possible."
"""If you aim at nothing, you hit nothing.""",
Should replace all Asia words with China!,
One of the Best Marvel Movies,"This movie is captivating! Put it on as essentially background noise and ended up being pleasantly surprised. Very well written and executed. Possibly even the best made marvel movie. I don't have any criticism, just positives to say about this film. I even started rewatching it again the other night because it's that good. A great one for the entire family."
Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings already became one of my favourite MCU flicks,
Very weak story and character,"I thought this was Legend of the Ten Rings but doesn't tell anything about the rings.

A lot of cliche and not-so funny moments but those will depend on viewer. What I'm unhappy about is the character development. I do not understand why Shang Chi is so upset at his father. I actually sympathize with the father. Shouldn't Shang Chi feel guilty for doing nothing and just watch his mom die rather than blame his father? And even after he knew his father was being used by the creatures in the dark, he says he'll kill his father???

Some good action sequence were also negated by bad dragon CG."
A generic marvel movie,
Shang-Chi made an impressive start into the MCU,"Lovely plot, great characters, awesome designs & costumes. As a martial artist fan I loved the fight choreography & stunts. They felt fresh and authentic.

The mix between Martial Arts, Action, Fantasy & Drama was great. I was worried about the movie, when I watched the trailer. The CGI effects were amazing. Just felt like it didn't needed it. The movie got its own marvel flavor, when the cgi scenes took over.

I had a lot of fun during watching. Specially the fighting scenes, action scenes and with a lovely humor.

The acting was fantastic. Shang-Chi's character development was great just overshadowed by his fathers character in my opinion, cause the story of his father was somehow more interesting. The chemistry between Shang-Chi & Katy was the icing on the cake. So lovely and perfectly matches into the movie.

This is the first Hollywood movie for Tony Leung. He did an amazing job.

I think it's safe to say they did well to represent Asian culture on a big movie screen. I highly recommend this to every marvel fan. They did an outstanding job."
One word: CGI,"The MCU has definitely reached its highest level as far as special effects are concerned, a really good job."
Convoluted and uninspired,
10/10 THE BEST MARVEL MOVIE TO DATE!,
Manage your expectations?,
"Visually stunning, looking forward to the next one","Without spoiling anything as this story stands by itself there's going to be a sequel and I really look forward to that. It was that good in my humble opinion. Visually it was just stunning, great CGI's, very well choreographed fighting scenes, and a story that was most entertaining to watch. Some might find it over the top but it's a Marvel so what do you expect? To me this is one of Marvels best movies yet if not the best. The acting was good as well, and that from the whole cast. I never heard of Shang-Chi before but from now he has one more fan. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings won't disappoint a lot of people, unless you're just not into this genre of movies. A must see for the fans."
Marvel PERFECTION,"Loved it.

Up there with the best Marvel films.

Funny with great action scenes and 'Kate' is the best."
Something new. Something amazing!,"I was not expecting to enjoy this movie as much as I did. I'm a sucker for a good martial arts movie and for traditional oriental music but we saw what happened the last time Marvel tried to do martial arts... (Iron Fist)

This movie is without question in my top 5 Marvel movies! The action is incredibly choreographed and there is not an overabundance of it. The score is beautiful and I have found myself listening to it regularly since I saw this film. Character development is top notch. All of these things needed to make a great movie is wrapped into a nice package sprinkled with that Marvel charm we have come to love over the years. I can't stress how much you need to see this movie."
"Funny, amazing action, epic family drama - I laughed, I cried - all the feels","I loved it, and so did the boys (my 25 and 31 year old boys)! It was funny, action-packed, and there was family drama on an epic scale. There was plenty of amazing martial arts action - my favorite was the first one on a runaway bus in San Francisco with 5 assassins and our reluctant hero. Also, there were magical creatures, a tragic love story, and a battle of good and evil. My older son is always the most critical of the three of us, and he loved it. His only criticism is that it wasn't much of a Marvel movie, but as an origin story, that did not bother me. There were 2 superhero cameos, and larger parts for Wong from Dr. Strange and Ben Kingsley reprising his role (as an actor hired to play a terrorist) from the Iron Man 3. In the end, the best thing that I can say is that when we walked out, we all said that we wanted to see it again!"
Great choreography and story,This movie had amazing choreography and a great story. It was a great mixture of comedy and seriousness and I can't wait to see what more they have of Shang Chi and the Ten rings.
Martial Arts in MCU...... And It works,"Compared to other action/kung fu movies, I think there's more impressive than those fights but even then; it still works. They well introduced martial arts and 10 rings and I'm impressed of how they use it in fights but I kinda want to see the unique powers of each rings (based in the comics). Still, It's entertaining, visually stunning and it's out of the MCU's pattern which is great. However, I'm not convinced of the Mandarin's motives. It kinda lacks evilness ( ""She"" is his weakness and that's why He's been easily manipulated by a beast and that kinda sucks). Everyone's scared of the Mandarin but in this movie they gave him too much of a heart. In spite of that, it is still a Great movie. I Enjoyed it Recommended to everyone."
Marvel is back!,"Black widow was a really good movie, but this is what marvel is all about! Amazing storyline, phenomenal action, and just the right amount of humor. This movie was an epic introduction to a character that I was previously unfamiliar with. The future is bright in the MCU."
Fabulous movie!,Really enjoyed the story and the acting was amazing.
Ben - Plot Device,
Shanghai wow,"Movie was amazing!! The best movie in mcu, better than endgame. Jorge Es mierda."
"I didn't know what to expect, but I was pleasantly surprised","With no real concept of the character or the story, I didn't really know what to expect from Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings. I was pleasantly surprised. This Marvel action film is above average, and features impressive visuals, engaging action scenes, and entertaining characters. There are some missing pieces in the story, which they may be saving for later, but overall, I enjoyed this introduction to a new MCU superhero."
worst marvel film so far,"A tough film to watch, struggled to keep my attention throughout the entirety of the film. The marvel movie formula did not translate this movie well.

No amount of cgi effects could save this movie from the dull plot.

With any luck this movie will not have any continuing role in the marvel franchise.

Worst marvel movie so far? I think so."
SO AMAZING,"I heard that this film was going to be good, and it was better than I had imagined!! The storyline was really new and exciting for the mcu, the fight scenes were fantastic I couldn't keep my eyes of the screen. It also had its funny parts just like marvel always has! I can't express enough how much I enjoyed this film."
Jaw dropping action and visuals.,"One of the best action movies till date.

One advice to DC fans: Stay away from giving negative rating out of jealousy. If you hate Marvel so much then stick to your DC comics and movies. Avoid giving false reviews and ratings to Marvel movies.

It's not gonna bring Marvel down."
MASTER OF MARTIAL ARTS,"I won't say believe on my review ...but just watch it once . It will worth your money and time . This movie has every thing you wanted to see in an origin movie 1) Really strong main villain 2) Awesome secondary villains 3) Nice Back story 4) 5 Star fighting scene and VFX 5) Villains from phase 1 and 2of iron man andnhulk 6) Magic and mystic , humor and emotion at right proportion Chery on top of cake = Post credit and mid credit."
"It's ok, but not great",
A fresh new perspective for Marvel,This movie reminds me of the old kung fu movies of Jackie Chan and Bruce Lee. The fight sequences are extremely well shot and choreographed and Wenwu might be one of the best villains of the MCU. Simu liu is a very charismatic actor and I'm hoping he gets his own sequel. Definitely recommend everyone to give this movie a watch.
Beautiful,"The story is good, the visuals are out of this world. You'll definitely enjoy it❤👌."
Amazing🔥🔥🔥,I really like this movie because this movie had comedy action and they really embraced the Chinese culture and I can't wait to see more of shang chi.
it's a kung fu movie more than a super hero one,"I loved it !

But it didn't quite feel like a marvel movie ...."
Best Origin Marvel Movie yet.,"Beautiful from start to finish. Amazing visuals, CGI and fight scenes. Acting was incredible, Tony Leung was so compelling as a villain. And so refreshingly funny too.

Best Marvel Origin story yet."
What a surprise!,"When you thought the MCU pulled everything out of the closet. This movie has everything. Amazing special effects, good editing, deserved character development and an intriguing plot. This movie is a solid blockbuster and very aesthetically pleasing.

The only bad thing about it was that at some point in the movie, it's enough. The ending felt like it was being dragged out.

This is the best MCU origin story by FAR."
Brilliant,No one to really write reviews but after seeing this thought I would tell people how good this film is . I thought I would like it a mix of Martial arts and marvel but it far exceeded expectations . It's fun with a great story and fantastic action but the Comedy bits are hilarious a must see for any marvel fan 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
Fresh,"Marvel have churned out hit after hit with the first 3 phases but this feels something different! A great film, great action sequences, good casting, a few surprises and cameos! Looking forward to this character progressing withing the marvel universe!"
Created an account just to review this.,"I was really looking forward to this movie. Initially, I was a bit upset that I wasn't going to be able to watch it on Disney+. However, after experiencing it on the big screen, I was so thankful I HAD to go to my local theatre to watch it. As a Chinese Australian, you rarely get to see characters that are similar to you. It was so nice to see asian experiences displayed unapologetically on the screen. The reviews that discuss how next level the martial arts are, really were telling the truth. I have seen plenty of Chinese dramas where martial arts is displayed full on & I always found myself thinking the filming direction was a bit off. This movie combined martial arts from the Chinese dramas & it was so natural and perfectly impactful. It is definitely not like the action shown in 2020's Mulan. The SFX was STUNNING, it's better than what the other Marvel movies have shown & we were just amazed at the effort and details that were placed.

I'm no acting major so I don't know my stuff but I did find some of Simu Liu's facials to be a tad awkward or a little too exaggerated however, he was still, nonetheless, wonderful in this role. Tony Leung, my god, he was the moment. He really shone in this movie for me. His natural swag & cool demeanour was so attractive and I really could not hate his character. I enjoyed Awkwafina's acting in this movie, she really knows how to deliver humorous lines & I'm glad she had an impactful part in the movie & wasn't just the comedy relief.

It did hurt to see that my cinema wasn't packed especially since my area is full of Asians. They may have not known about the movie since Marvel barely did any advertisement for it. I definitely hope in the future I get to see more support for Shang-Chi & the other members.

Regarding the credit scenes: the mid credits scene was definitely a ""huh, that's interesting"" moment but probably not something to cause any uproar over. I'm interested to see where it goes.

Overall, I REALLY enjoyed this movie. There was so much Mandarin incorporated in the movie that I am able to take my parents to watch it too!"
ONE OF BEST MARVEL MOVIES !!,"I was amazed by this one !!

THE SOUNDTRACKS, THE VISUALS !!

Loved everything in the movie.

Every moment was so Entertaining , I really enjoyed it."
Easily the most interesting and fresh marvel movie in a while,"Watch it it's very good. It has the best fight scenes in any marvel movie ever with cgi on such a huge scale you would think it was an avengers movie. The music could be better as it lacks in that, but the action and the characters make up for it."
"The MCU, has a massive hit on its hand with Shang-Chi","""Simu Liu"" really brings everything to life and embodies Shang-Chi to complete perfection, almost as if he was born for this role, to a point where he will become marvel fans new favorite, and In my opinion, is on par with the casting likes of ""Roberts Downey Jr"" (bold statement I know), but along side ""Simu Liu"" actress ""Awkwafina"" will also steal the hearts of many fans, bringing many smiles and laughs to viewers faces and becoming something so much more then just a side character, fans will route to see her more and more in the future future.

The actions scenes are nothing but bliss to see, perfectly choreographed fights that really capture the style and heart of martial arts. The special effects are beautiful to the eye and in the last two acts will simply blow you away and introduce you to a new world to see and new life to capture you and completely immerse you into the world of Shang-Chi.

As for the story, Shang-Chi carries alot of weight and heart, that will provide many laughs with its humor but will also pluck the strings of every ones heart, with out saying to much, Shang-Chis story is something of a symphony with its story telling, what could of ended up being a basic story, end up being a deep, thrieving with life, story with plenty of meaning, with a broken family at its heart, each character has their story, taking their different paths back to be whole again. Some fans my leave with a tear or two.

As a whole, Marvel manages to yet again, provide us an amazing cast to embody its iconoc comic characters and bring everything and every one to life on screen. Shang-chi, is a consistent adventure from start to finish and provides nothing but pure MCU entertainment at its finest, and will leave fans begging for more of Shang-Chi."
WOW! just wow.,"Despite them not promoting this a lot it was a game changer, different kind of genre and pace! They mixed and match well.

The CGI out of this world, and the acting chemistry between all actors, thanks for blessing us!

Best movie of this year, easily 10/10. You would be surprised with some newcomers to marvel!

Be prepared to have your mind blown!!!"
Creative and innovative ideas from Marvel!,"It's so amazing to see more Asian and female representation of films - this film is a representation of Marvel's ability to adapt, adapt to different cultures, languages, race. That they are able to create new story lines, but also branch them together. I have to say, amazing cast too! I can't wait to see what else Marvel has to bring out, I hope other studios take inspiration and follow suit. People enjoy different yet relatable, and this film didn't disappoint!"
One of the best marvel films I've seen in years,"I loved the aesthetics of the movie, the score, the acting, the story. One of the strongest marvel films I've seen in a long time."
A new start and TOP TIER marvel movie.,"Throw your expectations based on the marketing and promotional material away. This movie is fantastic. Yes, it is focused on the asian culture. No, it is not forced. It actually is beautiful.

The fighting choreography is fantastic. You like martial arts movies or martial arts in general? Go see this one.

The music is great. The humour is great. Actors are cool. Ben Kingsley has a great cameo. The story is cool. The ten rings will blow your mind. TWO post credit scenes that will blow your mind and a great soundtrack.

Where Black Widow felt like another movie of the same Marvel formula, this movie has some great surprises and worlds that are fun to explore.

Oh, go see it in theaters and don't wait for it to arrive on Disney Plus if you have the option to do that. The visuals are stunning.

9/10."
Breaks the Marvel mold,This film breaks the Marvel mold with its action and fantasy aspects. You can't prepare for what you'll see on screen. Just fantastic in every way.
Amazing Start,"From my opinion it's a very good and amazing start for the new phase and it's also considered as the real start,and the movie is better than black widow and spider man far from home,also the movie makes us very happy and can't wait the movies that are going to be released like eternals, and spider man no way home.

To conclude,the movie is a very good start for the new phase, big applause for the visual effects and cgi team,and I hope the new movies or the coming soon movies to be better and better."
Surprisingly good,
Unique New Marvel Idea that was Perfectly Done,"The Action in this film is top top notch , something we missed in marvel movies and shows, something very similar to what we saw in daredevil and iron fist.

I loved how this movie is tied to past and future marvel projects , making it an exciting and welcomed addition.

Actors did 10/10 in everything , and the story was well developed.

Don't forget : 2 post credit scenes."
Everything is just amazing,"From the never ending awesome action sequences to the beautiful music that enhances the experience tenfold, this movie is a masterpiece."
Unique MCU movie,"This was my initial first thoughts before entering the cinemas, ""am I going to enjoy it? Will it be filled with cgi crap?"" Well yes, but no. It was so beautifully done, that it made me saw wow at the end. This is something that you would wanna see in the theaters, it was so beautiful I even got posters for free of the movie to remind me of it. It's a movie you don't want to miss, seriously!"
AMAZING🔥🔥🔥,I have already watch this movie three times this movie was awesome. It had everything from action to comedy and the really embraced the Chinese culture in this movie. But I was more excited for the post credit scene and I think we have not seen the last of shang chi.
an amazing story,I just finished watching this and all i can say is this movie is soo unique. From the action to the atmosphere it just made this experience so great words can't even explain. I'm so eager to see what marvel has in store for us next!
I think it's the best marvell movie yet,"The 10 rings was the best weapon in marvel movies, the animation and action was beyond amazing..."
Marvel Has Lost Their Way,"I'm a huge Marvel fan and they continue to disappoint in this phase. It's all about shallow virtue signaling and not about character anymore. Why on earth did they decide to go in this direction after Endgame? This movie had it's moments but gets lost and it's on woke lack of depth. I pray this isn't the end of the marvel cinematic universe because we all enjoyed it so much. If it is the end, it was a great 11 year run. Don't waste your time with this nonsense."
MASTERPIECE,"This movie was amazing. Goes straight to my favourite movie list. It had an amazing story line, great acting, mesmerising cinematography and good humour. It had some spectacular fight scenes. I would definitely recommend this movie to everyone!!! It's a must see."
Excellent Action Fantasy Martial Arts Masterpiece,"I Saw this today at the BFI London IMAX with my 14 year old and his friend and we all enjoyed this immensely! Its thrilling & races along at a great pace from the first scene! It is the perfect mix of Action Fantasy & lighthearted comedy with a decent story line to bind it all together, one could say another typical Marvel movie churned out of their factory production line, however, I felt that this one really is miles better than so many of the recent ones due to the incredible martial arts fight scenes, they are so fast it's really exciting to watch. I also enjoyed the fact that I didn't recognise any of the main actors other than Ben Kingsley (who is hilarious) this often makes a movie much easier to get into than when it's the same old super star faces. No hesitation to recommend - great for the kids AND the adults too."
Bloody hell!!!,That movie was So good that my blood celly wanted see this masterpiece on they're own And my nose started bleeding in the Middle of the final fight.
Flying Fist of Phase 4,"A refreshing return to theatre going normalcy! The movie feels different from the previous Marvel movies and while I had low to no expectations from this movie, I was Iron Man'ed into falling in love with this movie and the character that AI formerly knew little about. The action was awesome the visuals both practical and CG were awesome and the story wasn't over complicated or too simple. Saw it with friends and we enjoyed it start to finish. Simu Liu and Awkwafina have great chemistry and Tony Leung Chiu-wai is very relatable and relatable as a villain and person. Over all I love the movie the most for feeling both down to earth and human while also being full Marvel wonder. Like Iron Man, the way it opens a wide and beautiful future for Marvel leaves me optimistic and excited."
It's not enough?? Hell No.,
Must watch,Awesome movie... To be honest one of the best marvel solo films everrr....
Kung-fu Superhero Fusion To Go Please,"The freshest new intro superhero film since Black Panther. Brilliant Asian casting elevates this latest Marvel addition which is crowd pleasing, emotional and visually strong. Some cute extra scenes in the credits so stick around."
Distinctly Marvel yet unique and Fresh!,An absolutely amazing movie! Some of the best special effects and fight sequences you'll ever see! Definitely a must-see!
Just marvel adding an asian based film😤,
Big Budgeted Wu Xia 101,
Legend of the mysterious 10 star reviews,
Not part of the MCU at all,"It's not a bad film per se, but just seems like marvel are pandering to the eastern market. Reminds me very much of. HD CT, but without the plot.

The addition of Wong seemed forced, and unnecessary at best

A poor attempt with only tenuous links to the rest of the universe."
Perfect blend of almost everything!,"Very well scripted for the character Shang-chi. This is marvel's first character which is introduced beautifully.

Movie is perfect blend of action+visual effects+locations+music. Each characters are awesome in their performance. However, role of Death Dealer could be more in the movie, but it's ok.

Visual effects are OMG! Marvel's best visual effect till the time in this movie. Action sequences are really amazing and you will love it. Background music of the movie really enjoyable, each scene has special music allotted so definitely you will enjoy full movie with it's uniqueness."
Diversity matters and this shows it,"Coming from an Asian American upbringing, I saw parts of my personal story play out on the big screen. There's something so affirming and beautiful about seeing parts of my story that I wanted people to understand now be on full display. Tony Leung specifically did a wonderful job depicting a complex father, something that we all can relate to in some shape or form. Marvel needs to invest in this franchise heavily."
Leung's acting overshadowed everything,
Marvel has nothing left to offer.,"Marvel has stopped trying and no longer wants to risk it. Why should they, when movies like this get all the praise.

In the beginning, Shaun was actually likeable, but as the movie progresses, he just kinda does stuff and his motivations are almost inexistent. The rest of the characters are bland and uninteresting.

The plot is all over the place and boring, filled with explanation after flashback after explanation, which makes it too long.

The fight scenes start off good, but then they just become huge and filled with cgi, and that just makes it boring for me.

In conclusion, this is a weekend movie to see with your family when it comes on tv, the kids will love it but the adults will forget it after 3 days. Just a generic tasteless movie."
Theater Worthy,"This movie was so well made. Of course it has your typical marvel magic, action, and comedy, but it's really fantastic. The build up, the dialogue, the action was all very moving. This is definitely worth seeing on the big screen."
Packleader,Outstanding marvel movie and waiting for the new version of avengers.
what happens to put Chinese myth in a Mavel story,
This Movie is the Best Solo MCU Movie till now!!!,"This movie was phenomenal. We cant expect more from a solo superhero MCU film. Everything was perfect. All the scenes were great. The graphic works were so eye catching!! The dialogues specially the joke parts were great. In this movie they portrayed the family drama in a fantastic way. The action scenes are eye touching too. Also some parts were emotional when we almost cried....

If any of you who have not still watched the movie and reading this comment,my first suggestion will be please don't miss the mid credit scene. Your mind will gonna blow up!!!"
I love that movie.,"I like this movie very much, the action fighting is very good."
Appealing in visuals and characters,"Let me start off by saying that this film is a nice blend of spider-man, and ant-man, when you look at the personality and humor of the characters. But in a way, this is honestly every marvel movie in one. The visuals are reminiscent of dr strange, the humor is quite like ragnarok, and the characters and backstory is just fantastic. A great movie to watch with your family, but it's also great for marvel fans. Maybe one of the best marvel superhero origin stories. The pacing is decent, and the visuals are phenomenal. And you'll be happy with all the little easter eggs and extras. This is a very fun movie, it's not too dark, and i can recommend this for every marvel fan out there, it's definitely worth the watch. You will not be to disappointed."
Action/ Story / Feelings are on the topnotch,"Loved The Way How the Story Revolves around Shang chi It's like a Fantasy Journey to His World And The Actions are Super satisfying .

Can't wait to see them on next avenger Film."
"A SPECTACULAR ENTERTAINING ACTION,BEAUTIFUL ROMANCE,COMEDY & SAD DRAMA MCU movie!","WOW! This movie wasn't bad at all...

-the action fight scene was a mixture of classical chinese martial arts choreography as flying & floating around as some 1970s classic chinese kung fu movies like hidden dragon, crounching tiger & jet li's once upon a time in china with also realistic fighting style as well as jackie chan fighting style with a mixture of fantasy magic power of fighting style like ""dragon ball-Z"" lol.

-the romance scene was soo beautiful with both shang-chi mother & father a better romance movie than other marvel superhero movie lol.

-the landscapes & background graphics were so amazing well done! It is soo enjoying to see a beautiful landscapes of grass, trees, & with chinese mythology creatures.

-the funny scene was really enjoyable to watch with mostly KATY !! Shang-chi close friend lol.

-the storyline was 4 main character was SHANG-CHI, XIALING, WENWU, & JIANG LI. It was a very well done well written story line plot of these 4 main characters by showing flashbacks to the past of what had happened to these 4 characters.

-the script was well done some had some serious scripts as WENWU,XIALING & SHANG-CHI but only 2 has the funny scripts as KATY & TREVOR SLATTERY! Lmao.

-2 villains that work for WENWU was very well done made with their own job to do which was Razor-fist & Death dealer...

-the most sad drama part was shang-chi father being stuck in the past with his wife that died long ago. Its was heart felt as heart broken... :-("
Worth the COVID risk of a theater visit,"Easily landed in my Top 3 MCU Films Thus Far. All the epic action and gorgeous cinematography you'd expect from a wuxia movie with a Marvel budget, with great acting from Leung and Awkwafina and particular and rich references to Chinese myth."
Surprisingly good and definitely worth watching,"I went to the cinema to watch this movie in IMAX 3D and the money was definitely worth it. Honestly this is my favourite stand alone film in the MCU. The visual effects are outstanding, as well as the fight scenes and some good comedy though :)). I recommend everyone (not just Marvel fans) to watch this movie."
Beautiful,"Well written, funny and well made, this movie make you smile, relax, laugh and hype you up at the same time, watched it in the theaters yesterday and I have to say that it's truly a masterpiece."
WHAT A ORIGIN STORY SHOULD BE,
Great story,Really original and shows a new direction the filming of the MCU can take.
Immersive and fun,"Going into this the trailers had me excited but i was blown away by seeing it in IMAX opening night. Definitely going again later in the week, it really deserves a rewatch."
Marvel at its Prime,
The future if the MCU is here,"The action in this film was in fact a character. Simi Liu, Awkwafina, and of course Michelle Yeah deliver beautiful performances! Shang Chi is this generation's Iron Man. The MCU is in perfect hands."
Very enjoyable,
"Fantastic, a must watch for marvel fans",Loved the fight sequences and I was blown away in the second half of the movie .. It's like on another level! Phenomenal.
Awesome Fight Scenes,"When the movie first started... I felt like I was watching a ""foreign"" film. No English just Chinese with English subtitle? Didn't know what to expect in this movie. Then later on, the casts started speaking English & the awesome fighting scenes kicked in. OMG!! How exciting~ The fighting choreography was unbelievable. Just as good as Jackie Chan movies!

The storyline was alright but the CG was very good. They used lots of Chinese culture tradition, costume & symbols. Looking forward to see the next sequel."
best movie since infinity war,"Great characters strong plot amazing visuals pretty serious movie, none of the typical unnecessary marvel humour."
Some of the best written characters in a marvel movie yet!,"Just saw the movie in the theater and I haven´t spoken a word since. The movie truly takes you on a journey you don´t expect. The characters are the most immersively written ones yet, you can truly relate to (most) all of the main ones. Tied in beautifully with modern culture, I love the platonic friendship between Katy and Shang it feels real. The movie has it's moments of just sheer beauty. And I liked the humor. Does it have some points of improvement? Sure. The immersion was broken a handful of times for me, however all together I loved the journey I was taken on. For anyone who hasn't seen it yet. 10/10 Fantastic journey, enjoy the experience!

(p.s. The music was sick, I loved it!)"
Love it,"Well, what a gem. A movie to make you smile and laugh in times of covid restrictions. Ben Kingsley is very good and plays his part very well. A movie for all the family, thrills and spills with fantasy. Listen for some cracking one liners."
"The Chinese art and mythology is great, the plot is bareboned and tame",
An average movie at best,"I have no idea of what the story of this character is in the comics, but the way it was depicted in this movie was okay-ish at most, and is barely entertaining, thanks to the usual AAA SFX.

Not sure if this is supposed to please asian people with their full asian cast (i don't count cameos), the same way black panther was to black people but i pretty much find it ridiculous everytime a movie does this sort of thing."
What a mess!!,"How on earth has this got a higher rating than No TIme To Die??

Bad Script filled with the typical Disney cliche characters and fluffy toys that can be sold on.

To much dodgy green screen and awful cgi.

Terrible Terrible mess of a film.

3/10."
Too Fakey for Martial Art Fans.,
Meh at its best!,"I just watched this on Disney+ and I was incredibly excited to watch it! Unfortunately much of that excitement was lost halfway through.

It started to become overly cheesy, and I don't know why! And the special effects, as much as some of it was beautiful, got to be quite cartoony instead of realistic.

The 2 credit scenes were brilliant, and Awkwafina stole the movie for me (she was fantastic!)...but aside from that I would say not the best Marvel offering.

I'm actually glad that I waited and didn't waste money to see this at the cinema. Sorry!!"
Nice kung-fu scenes...,"The movie had nice kung-fu scenes and nice fighting effects. But overall it was underwhelming.

First of all, was I the only one who was annoyed byt Katys character. I didn't understand why she even was in the movie. She didn't contribute to the storyline at all. She was just an annoying side chick with unnecessary and unneeded comments of what was going on. I wanted to turn off the movie every time she opened her mouth. So why the heck would Marvel make her in to a canon????

And second off, it was a very jumpy storyline. Some things did not add up. Like why the heck did Shang-Chis mother fall in love with his father. Especially after he said that he was there to conquer her village. Like, her first thought went to playing tricks on him and eventually dancing with him instead of trying to protect her village from him. Like, say what???

Overall a mellow movie. Marvel could have done it much better, especially if they cut out Katys character and focused more on Shang-Chis sister. The sister had at least a much cooler character!"
Ordinary,Pretty ordinary movie. The movie is nothing but a poor effort of trying add Chinese flavor in Marvel's Universe and lure Chinese crowd. Never felt immersed in the story.
Pedestrian,"After a promising and colorful opening in a magical forest, the movies meanders. It is like a lesser Disney movie, but with a few good fight scenes. The fight on the bus is maybe the best. The lead actor is good, but he is given little to do; same for Akwafina. So many scenes in the first half are shot in low lighting, for no good reason. Everything else is meh or plain silly."
"Thrilling, funny, really well made","Definitely a great Marvel movie. Great story, marvelous cast, you can't miss a beat!"
About marvel,"Best marvel solo movie must watch in theaters.

Action scenes are awesome, characters are good and post-credit scene will give goosebumps."
Good but not best,The movie was good but the story was repeated so many time I had a feeling while watching that its just a marvel version of the movie raya who's so much better.
AMAZING,"That was AMAZING I thought nothing would take my favorite marvel movie place from avengers infinity war,but I was wrong, because Shang chi took it!"
Instantly Bonafide MCU Smash,"A great mix of action, levity, and family drama (who can't relate to that?) not seen since Captain Marvel (a cat hacking a tesseract hairball ... again who can't relate).

It is a visual masterpiece with elements any fan of The Legend of Zelda : Breath of the Wild will swoon over (maybe not something everyone can relate to).

If the 10 Rings ""ring"" a bell ... check out Iron Man 3 for a refresher.

Also make sure to hang around for mid- and end-credit scenes."
Mind is blown away!,The movie was absolutely AMAZING! I wish I can see it over and over it again! Defiantly will watch it again.
Great movie!,This movie is a great introduction to the character and has a pretty epic ending. Looking forward to seeing more of Shang Chi!
Great intro movie,Really good movie very immersive recommend it to all fans.
Beginning of the phase 4,"Great Story, great action. This is the movie you definitely wanna watch to bring back that Marvelness."
Marvel!,"Well, here we are... The truth is out: most of the movies by Marvel are way better than most of the movies by anyone else. There's a story, beautiful visuals, love and drama, some comedy - a package well worth big screen experience! Go and see it if you are a fan of action and/or fantasy magical movies! It does it all."
back to big screens,"Went to cinemas after year and half .Totaly worth it,macau fight scene stole the movie."
Beautiful,"Honestly one of the best Marvel movies made to date, up-to-par and could even surpass Black Panther. The acting (especially Tony Leung, the dad) was incredible, along with the visuals, soundtrack, storyline, and writing. Loved how they actually spoke Chinese in the authentic scenes vs making them speak english the whole time with an accent. True to the Asian culture, and definitely did us proud!"
Very Well Done!! I love it!,"I really liked this movie and I'm a full-on marvel fan, I usually like Wanda over all the other characters, but this film makes me like Shang-Chi now too. And all this time I would have never thought I would like another character. Marvel, you have outdone yourselves for sure!"
Another Marvel Great,"Perfect casting, great flow throughout, solid story and character development. Great movie to take the family to watch. Provides many topics for conversation-change for the better, start doesn't dictate the end, see the good in all, cherish our loved ones and many others. For me the mark of a really good movie is the can't wait for the next movie and I can't wait for chapter two!!"
I never write reviews...,"I never write reviews but let me tell you I enjoyed this movie with every inch of my heart and I speak for the rest of the people in the theate as well, it was definitely a big win for Chinese-Americans I just simply enjoyed how it portrayed both the English and Chinese language! I recommend this movie to anyone or any family out there looking for a good laugh and a beautiful cinematic piece. SHANG-CHI:)"
Amazing movie! Go see it!!!!,Watch this in theaters! It was a great storyline with well developed characters. The entire cast was fantastic and it had moments of humor and seriousness seamlessly blended in! Loved seeing an Asian superhero who rocked it!! He was brilliant.
Master class,"Best action and sci fi movie ever. Pliz go and watch this movie, it's one of the finest movie of marvel, marvel do good job."
By far the best debut Marvel movie in 'MY' opinion.,"The VFX and CGI of this movies were both great and the best in a debut movie in my point of view, the action scenes were so good even my father who didn't wanted to see the movie loved it.

And the movie is purely family friendly.

Overall I really liked the movie, it made a lot of new fans of the MCU community."
Above 8? How?,"Another global treath.

Another villain that gonna kill the entire reallity. (Speaking abault this, whats the name of the villain again? Oh, I cant remember.) Another secret organization that ""shape the history"", ""take down government"" bla bla bla.

Its not a good movie. The script its bad, some characters are forced into the movie. Even the CGI, too much CGI, and It is not a good CGI."
"The calm of the west, expressed in a subtle way.",Action packed movie with comedy... and the KAMEHAMEHA.....
spectacular movie to watch,"Growing up as a kid on kung fu movies, Went into shang-chi with opened mind.

Well, It blown me away, The cast were outstanding, the visual effects, Cinematography, vibrant colours, the fight scenes are fantastic and Enjoyed the music as well.

Found myself laughing at time, exited and emotional.

MCU have added more characters, diversity and new possibilities.

Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings was spectacular movie to watch."
Awesome,Well it's 9.5 This movie is deserved to be watched at theaters Action-11/10 Emotion-9/10 Story-10/10 The only flaw in this movie is it is little bit fast paced.
Amazing,It was amazing from the visuals to the depth of the store to the inside jokes that only true marvel fans will notice. This just another masterpiece made by marvel studios.
Amazing!!,Was such a great movie and then the climatic fight was amazing (side note if Disney got the rights to do a dragon ball z live action movie it would be great if they use the same director of this movie)
Fantastic,
AMAZING MOVIE,"This movie was spectacular. From the visuals, action sequences, and soundtrack. Everything was amazing. Literally had full body chills watching this movie!"
A Marvelous Ride,"At first glance, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is emotional, engaging and action packed. The truth is that there's so much more behind the surface. It is a story of self discovery, full of great character arcs, glorious fight scenes and dynamic choreography. Simu Liu really shines as the main character: he brings so much charm to the role that it's easy to grow fond of him. The director, Destin Daniel Cretton, manages to create a new mythology, both inspired by the comics and the Chinese tradition. The visual effects are great, even outstanding during certain moments, as well as the concept design of all the mythical creatures. Finally, the music really meshes amazingly with the scenes, especially when there's more action and emotion. A new modern superhero has arrived and he's ready to deliver some punches. This movie really pulls off a great origin story that proves, once again, the endless possibilities the Marvel Cinematic Universe has yet to offer."
Great movie,"Great movie and fight scenes, recommend to everyone."
THE EXCELLENT,"There is no need to explain about a MARVEL MOVIE. And it's a excellent debut movie for a new hero. VALUE FOR MONEY! Greatest movie of all time in action and BGMs are awesome, Chinese tunes!!! Action Scenes are best in all time Marvel Movies... EXCELLENT VFX AND CGI atlast I'm giving to this movie, I CAN'T RATE THIS MOVIE... EXCELLENT!

You should've watch this MASTERPIECE..."
Great movie!,It wasn't bad I really liked it. I'm not even a big marvel fan but I really enjoyed this movie.
Fantastic fight scenes,"I wasn't expecting much when I first heard about it, but the storyline is one of a kind and I definitely enjoyed the fight scenes."
Wonderful,"I had read the advance reviews and was excited about the positivity and glowing feedback I'd seen. It means a lot to Asian-Americans to finally be put in the spotlight, and by a juggernaut like the Marvel machine no less.

Went to see a late night showing on Thursday, Sept 2nd, technically a day in advance of the official release date. Happy to say the movie did not disappoint. I've watched so many Hong Kong style movies over the years and the Shang-Chi film-making team did a spectacular job of importing that authentic, Asian-flavor of film-making. They did the kind of research I've come to expect from Marvel's creative team, and let this team leave their own distinct Chinese style from using Mandarin-speaking dialogue in strategic moments, to the very distinct style of Chinese-influenced music (totally awesome!), and the kung-fu sequences on the scaffolding, which is something you see in many of the old school Kung Fu movies. Michelle Yeoh, in particular, acted in many a movie in this vein back many years ago.

The filmmakers did a great job of melding old-style, Authentic Chinese Kung Fu cinema and themes (father-son tension, motherly devotion, male prioritized over female, etc .) with current Asian-American themes (underachieving children and over-expecting parents, general confusion in American society) and combining everything in the context of a fantasy-action movie with trademark Marvel humor to lighten things up.

I was a fan of the special effects throughout the movie, and thoroughly enjoyed the ending sequence as well. Like other reviewers, I loved the opening fight sequence between Tony Leung and Fala Chen. It's wonderful to see that Tai Chi - style of fighting introduced in a Western, blockbuster movie.

Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was a great movie but with Shang-Chi, I think Marvel achieved something more in melding disparate parts and taking on much more in bringing together cultures, generations and viewpoints in the context of a MCU superhero action movie. The next time we see Shang-Chi, there's no doubt most of us - moviegoers of all colors and cultures - we will be happy to see him again."
Great in 4DX,"The movie was phenomenal in a 4DX theater. The fight scenes in the movie felt real and close to Hong Kong fighting movies. The story behind Shang-Chi is set up through his father, which is unique through the MCU."
Marvel has stepped it up again!,"Very great choreography, every fight tells a great story and the movie grabs your attention and doesn't let go. Only reason that this isn't 5 stars is that the final act did what Black Panther did, became too superheroy and got distracted by CGI battles rather than getting into a great family battle between father and son. Still other than that the movie was fantastic and more people need to go see and support this film!"
Very engaging plot with great visual effects,"I find this film very engaging from start to finish. I couldn't get my eyes off the screen! The Kung Fu is very good, and the visual effects are wonderful. I enjoyed every second of this film."
Shang chi and the beginning of a new era,"Let me start by saying damnnn, Marvel made an absoluut banger of a movie. It has one of the most developed antagonist in a marvel film and the CGI is just stunning to watch, let alone a very good story and all the great fight scenes.

From beginning to end I had one big smile. If this is the first film of phase 4 then I can only expect bigger things to happen.

Of course if you are a marvel fan go watch it!! But also if you are not this is in my opinion the best marvel film made and definitely worth your money.

Phase 4 is destined for greatness."
Embarrassing,"Marvel is losing it and it is becoming embarrassing and ugly. Black Widow was pretty bad, this is downright awful. The script was beyond idiotic (want your kids to come home? Send assassins to kill them), the pacing was all over the place and Katy has to be the worst combination of annoying character and annoying actress since Rose Tico. Seriously, cut your losses and run."
Epic,"Simply epic. I'm sorry but only reason to hate this is if you're bigoted. It's one of the greatest Marvel Origin films ever. No weak moments. Great characters, great plot."
My Favorite Marvel,"This is my new favorite Marvel, everything was perfect from acting to storyline. Only problem, that actor Ben Kingsley didn't belong in there, otherwise it's 10/10 two thumbs up."
Hollywood still sucking up to China,"Forget it boys, China is more interested in its own movie industry than yours. All you're doing is making yourselves look foolish. Like John Cena's grovelling apology.

Anyhoo, this movies okay for a superhero movie. Perfectly suitable for the braindead who don't like real movies. Backstory, some talking, big action scene. Wash, rinse, repeat."
lame attempt,
Unmarvelling,"I'll be brief.

Clearly much effort, thought and funding has gone into this flick but it only goes to show that one can assemble all the right ingredients in a recipe and still make a meal of it.

It has good action, but the live action CG is stale and the transitions always evident.

It has a solid storyline, but the padding is average.

It has good actors, but in support roles only.

In a movie where you know the hero will ultimately triumph, it's all about how you get there.

This journey was underwhelming."
Nearly perfect,
This is DEFINETLY not a waste (for a marvel film),"---Fast review: Good effect, exciting figth scenes, satisfying story---

> I normally don't like most marvel movies because bla bla.. > However, as a martial arts fan, performer and chinese culture and mythology fan, i decided to watch it (because there is use of martial arts) and unexpectedly satisfied.

> There is a good base, universe of chinese mythology. They may waste it but they definetly use it very well. Effects are realy good, i especially like effects of portals and water tornado of dragon.

> Fight scenes (which is the most interested part for me of course) are really good, some parts are so fast to detect movements.

> Visual effects of kung fu (not style of main character but his mother and her people) describe the philosophy under the style very well. Their kung fu is so smooth, basic and easily recognisable because most is traditional style.

>I was very happy when i saw some movements that i use."
All the ingredients,Imagine a movie with well timed jokes and action pacing sequences crossed with the magical world of Asian mythology and Kung Fu and you got Shang-Chi. 10/10.
A Middle-of-the-road film that should have been better,"Marvel's newest solo film that introduces an iconic hero from thier vast collection of heroes is certainly for the newer fans that didn't grow up with ""The Master of Kung-Fu"". Even Stan Lee (who was in charge of the company but didn't create Shang-Chi) has admitted he was a comic rip-off of Bruce Lee in looks and style. Adding a mystical and possible alien influence was in my view a mistake and not true to the character's story. Nor the reimaging of The Mandarin, which I found to be disappointing. Aside from the tired storylines which have become common in these Marvel films, the ending was a little over the top. Aside from these criticisms, I'll give kudos to a good cast and wonderful cinematography. If I ever get a faithful adaption of a Marvel comic I grew up with, I might be shocked. I am coming to the conclusion that these films are only for those under 30, since I don't recognize the heroes or villains. Not the worse film in the Marvel universe but not the best."
Shang-Chi was the Mulan that the 2020 Mulan should have been,"Shang-Chi did just about everything right. It really was the Mulan that the live action Mulan tried to be and should have been.

It had comedy, suspense, amazing martial arts, female heroines and of course a dragon.

I went into this not expecting to like it but I was pleasantly surprised.

If they only gotten Henry Golding a role, the movie would have been a 10."
The new character in Marvel,Amazing personality. Amazing personality. Amazing personality. Character is not very funny. I love the character. I love Marvel and the heroes. Thanks Marvel.
A great start for phase4,Enjoyed every action scene. Must watch in big screens.
Marvel have outdone themselves,"PART WITH NO SPOILERS This film was absolutely amazing! Almost every aspect of the film was perfect and it smashed my expectations and took it's place as one of the best Marvel films, or any films that I have seen.

The visual effects in this movie were fabulous, there were plenty of captivating scenes with astounding usage of modern technology. The cinematography was probably one of the best I have seen in a film for a while, it kept you captivated and on your toes the entire time! I also noticed light being used to make the scenes even more captivating, which is something you don't always see in films.

The dialogue was solid and didn't feel clunky or wierd, the jokes were well spaced and gave your muscles a rest from being tensed.

The action was perfectly filmed and beautiful, it felt like they were dancing. The choreography was very impressive.

The story itself was nothing unexpected, pretty much a generic origin story, but don't worry that doesn't take away from the film at all!

And lastly the villain was for me one of the most interesting aspects of the film, they made you feel for him and gave him an interesting charachter with a non-generic motive, I haven't felt for a villain this much for a long while.

PS: There are two post credit scenes so stay after the credits.

PART WITH SPOILERS And I just wanted to say I loved the return of Trevvor Slattery! It was such a surprise and something they managed to keep out of the trailers, he was hilarious especially where he played dead. Also I like the fact Wong played a role in the film, the scenes with him were interesting. The post credit scenes set up the sequel which I will be very interested to see! Can't wait to find out what the sister does and who the rings are calling."
Awesome movie,
Great action movie and surprisingly hilarious!,"I was worried this movie would be a bust but it was SO much better than Black Widow AND had some great fight scenes. Though it's not my favorite Marvel movie of all time (I am a huge Marvel fan), I found it to be a decent action movie and a pretty good plot for a Marvel origin story.

Tony (The Mandarin) was freaking AMAZING, some of the best acting I've seen in a Marvel movie and by far the best actor in the movie. Akwafina surprised me as I thought she was an odd casting choice but her and Simu had great on chemistry on set. Also shout out to WONG the OG Asian marvel superhero.

Definitely see this movie!!!!!"
Most action packed movie,Marvel make a awesome file in the 2021 And thier stories of the character are so deep and the VFX was just wow I love this movie.
A really generic and a Marvel pattern movie,Marvel Studios apparently doesnt learn from its mistakes while they are profitable and makes another movie with tons of jokes instead of focussing on character development.
Very good movie,"I've seen it in cinemas about an hour ago, I was very impressed :)."
The marvel universe,The marvel universe has excelled here .. pure pure brilliance ! So good !
Some of the best animation I've ever seen,"So personally I'm not huge into the marvel scene so my score came as a surprise to me. The acting and character development was impressive in its own right, with a good scaling plot that never felt slow but built up like a good song.

There were a few moments where the animation completely blew me away, I've seen every new film in the cinemas for the past while and plenty of animation in and out of cinema and some moments were truly incredible.

Would recommend anyone to go and see this, easily my favourite action film and maybe my outright favourite film."
ORIGIN,"POSITIVE -great Casting (SImu Liu, Tony Lueng). Especially Tony Lueng because he look badass and has great acting skill.

-You've already heard people praising the film's action choreography, and it's well-deserved. It doesn't has many cut scenes like many MCU fighting scenes.

-This film felt completely unique from what we've seen from the MCU already.

-Props to the beautiful cinematography and soundtrack as well, they were great!

-The first two act was incredible and amazing showing the life of Shang-Chi, how Wenwu meet his wife etc. This type of act is something MCU usually doesn't have.

-This film open up MCU to new world with myth creature, many evil organization, and the mystery of the Ten Rings.

NEGATIVE -The casting was STELLAR. Aside from the one person I didn't care for (*Razor Fist, cough cough*) everybody played their roles to perfection.

-The jokes may not be funny to some people. But It's funny to me.

-The only issue I had with Shang-Chi was the third act. Not that it was bad, but it felt detracting from what the first 2/3rds of the movie established. It become every MCU logic part(CGI BATTLE). It took away from the great hand-to-hand action stunt work, but it's to be expected from a film of this genre.

character into this universe.

IMO Great way to introduce new hero. Great Martial art fight scenes. Great characters. Looking forward to Shang-Chi. Also Wenwu.

Not a Top Tier Film in Movie Industry but A Top Tier Film in MCU STANDALONE movies."

Hands down brilliant.. Thank you Marvel for giving us such a new world.. Excellent from everyone.. Simu Liu is just a star and long way to go.. Best choice for the role.
Movie of the year,This is hands-down movie of the year. Do yourself a favor and go see this on the big screen! This is one of those movies there in 20 years you'll say I seen that on the big screen!
BEST MARVEL SOLO MOVIE!!!,After two and half years gap all the audience came back together to watch a Marvel movie shang-chi and the legend of the ten Rings is one of the most action packed and entertaining movie it does it keeps you engaged till the end of the movie The action sequences and the visual effects are top-notch the costume designing and the actors you simu like awkwafina the theatres were Housefull in India. This movie has a craze in India one of the best moral movies after 2 years at soft tomorrow will must watch movie only in theatres not in home.
A great kung fu fantasy movie set in modern times,"This movie has great kung fu, wonderful story, good acting besides the usual special effects. I enjoyed this movie more than ""black widow"". The action would be home in any of the classic kung fu movies.

I hope the shang chi and the ten rings returns soon."

Boring family drama....,So so boring movie didn't expect this from Marvel....so much annoying movie.
"Wow, wow! Best movie in a while","Well here's my review. After just reading the reviews on here I came across some bad reviews and laughed at them. Most of them are saying the villain was bad (not a spoiler: his dad) or they are saying it doesn't fit in the new marvel universe. I also saw one review who gave a 1/10 and said it was because of one of the actors in the post credits scene. For the people who are reviewing bad reviews don't like a new superheroes being Asian.

The movie was a perfect it made you feel sorrow for the character and the position he was in between his father. You could feel the weight he had on his shoulders. The beginning of the movie starts with the fear of unknown, you don't know who is after him. You go through many happy and sad emotions. The movie also did a excellent job using the characters native language. The fight scenes are astonishing and the cgi was beautiful. The wasn't any cgi characters that didn't look real. The cast and crew should be proud of a beautiful masterpiece they made. Amazing amazing!"
One word: Beautiful,"Aesthetically beautiful and such likable characters.

Amazing work by Simu Liu and Awkwafina. Also a special shoutout to Ben Kingsley whose Trevor Slattery made me laugh so hard everytime he was on the screen.

Can't wait to see what's coming in the MCU to these amazing characters."
Must...Consume...Next...Disney...Product,Me consume all Disney product. Disney product never stop. Me eat every one. I no care or ask just consume. Open my mouth insert each product Disney make.
Was ok didn't have much of a plot,It was ok not much of a plot a lot of action. The whole movie seemed like it was adding up to another movie.
visually stunning superhero film,"This movie blew me away with the effects and how beautiful it is , the fight scenes were so greatly choreographed and the tracking cinematography was just perfect and made the scenes flow so well , the backgrounds were just perfect and very aesthetic . The chemistry between the characters was just perfect and the jokes were funny, its so good to see a platonic relationship between a man and a woman . It is definitely worth a watch at the cinema."
Damn you Marvel (shakes fist at sky),"I really wasn't expecting this to be so good but it was, and more so. Just when you thought that End Game had wrapped everything up you can see yourself getting sucked in all over again."
100/100,Martial-arts master Shang-Chi confronts the past he thought he left behind when he's drawn into the web of the mysterious Ten Rings organization.
Disappointing,"For the first time, the fight with two people was so amazing, but the farther, the more boring. Too many characters and effects have made the movie a mess and not very real."
Good movie,"I have seen it at the premier. 3D is recommended. It seems Marvel is siding toward mystic and magic instead of science. As I am a hardcore marvel fan since my childhood, I liked it. Specially the Bus fight scene. Don't know about casual watchers."
Lots of fun,"Great combination of high energy action, emotional context, and funny. It was a great introduction to these characters. Looking forward to seeing them more!"
"WOW, finally a good work from disney after spiderman far from home","Amazing CGI,story, beginning of a new character and absolutely amazing credit shot In this movie every second your are going to open your mouth and surprised Good luck for the fourth stage, This movie raised my expectations for other works, I pray they don't drop again."
A classic shaped movie yet with marvel touch,"Oh is it beautiful.

The coregraphy, the fights, the landscape, the colors...

The story and the script is previsible, it's good sometimes to have something classic and there it works.

I always though marvel universe movies have less fight , all reunited, with a classic Hong Kong movies such John Woo ones.

Here my toughs are listened and this is easely the most fight based of all MCU movies ever.

I had a great time. Great subjects, editing, actors.

I have preferred this one globally than Black Widow because i see and live what i was expecting and even more."
Great Marvel movie with GREAT CGI sequences!,
Garbage,In a word this is garbage. Martial Arts films have been done far too much and this one so far over the top it was ridiculous. Disney should not use the Marvel name to disguise a film that fails to represent the Marvel Universe. People who enjoy martial arts in its most ludicrous form will most likely will enjoy this but after a 15 minutes I was so bored by it I could hardly keep my eyes open. Disney is trying to dismantle the Marvel Universe and replace it with the Marvel Mouse Universe.
A must watch! Amazing movie!,"This is one of the MCUs finest movie.

The VFXs are the best, the story is the best and the Direction...Amazing direction.

The movie is full of adventure. A Must Watch !!"
10/10,"The reason I like this movie so much is because the movie is very easy to understand. The jokes were fine, the cgi was amazing. And it's different than most marvel movies. And Simu Liu is an amazing actor and played the role amazingly."
Marvel Fanatic Left Speechless,"Usually I write a lot more in these reviews. I'm a 'see it on the first showing' for every Marvel movie and series - and this has left me without any superlatives. Amazing, 10/10."
A masterpiece,"Love everything the visuals,nature, action, acting everything on point Best Superhero movie of the year he'll yes New fav avenger Shang-chi."
Exceed expectation,"The fighting scenes were amazing, especially the intro and the ending."
A Marvel Legend has risen,"A Marvel Legend has risen and it only took 40 years to become an overnight sensation.

""Kim's Convenience"" star Simu Liu breathes life into the title character who's changed his birth name to Shaun.

What a stretch when you don't want to be found by your estranged dad, Xu Wenwu otherwise known as The Mandarin, played by Tony Chiu-Wai Leung (in his first American film) who has more rings than Ringo Starr or the Olympics.

What can I say this guy loves his bling.

Rapper/Actor Awkwafina is his BFF, Katy.

Together Shaun goes out of his way to avoid bringing back the dead with his wisecracking ""Crazy Rich Asian"" girlfriend in tow.

Simu was so intent of getting this gig that back in 2018 he tweeted Marvel for the role.

Kung Fu fans are in for a solid 2 hour plus fight spectacular, which doesn't stop too long to draw breath.

This movie never gets boring.

It's Action, Adventure and Fantasy all rolled into one thrill ride straight out of the Marvel Universe.

I kind of half expected 80's Singer, Limahl to crank out ""Never Ending Story"" in the final act of this epic movie thanks to one of the legendary creatures hiding out in a mythical village not unlike Shangri-La from 1937's classic ""Lost Horizon"".

Car maker BMW clearly have a product placement deal with Producer, Kevin Feige.

They are driven, crushed or smashed in every automobile scene.

Hawaiian Director, Destiny Daniel Cretton, best known for ""Just Mercy"" and ""The Glass Castle"" does a marvellous job with the Screen Play and Screen Story he helped write based on the source material from Marvel Comics Steve Engelhart and Jim Starlin.

This movie idea has been floating around since the 80's when the late Stan Lee wanted Bruce Lee's son, Brandon to play the lead, but that plan fell through.

Australia actually played a huge part in this movie finally being produced despite World War C's best attempt in 2020 to shut down production.

Watch out for: Michelle Yeoh plus Aussies Ronnie Chieng, Lynette Curran and Lydia Sarks (from the Toyota Commercials) as the hilarious Flight Attendant.

Like all good Marvel movies there is an Easter Egg worth waiting for before the cinema lights come on and the curtains close on the big screen.

And just like the movie this review doesn't mention the title till the final frame, ""Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"".

Do yourself a favour and take the family to see the 25th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe which is full of surprises and cameos.

MCU's first with an Asian leading Superhero Protagonist!"
A huge dud,"This is the first Marvel film since 2012's The Avengers that I would call a big dud. The reasons for its failure are many; the reasons that it almost succeeds are exactly two: Nora Lum (Awkwafina) and Ben Kingsley. Aside from these two shining points of light, the film's an energetic flop.

The main reason for the failure is the script. Now, I have been watching movies for five decades, and I can tell when a film is paying homage to another film, and when it's just ripping off the ideas of a better movie. This 'script' rips off a series of better movies, starting with Deadpool 2, then Fight Club, then Skyfall, then Avatar, and probably a bunch of other action films I never saw. Along the way, we are asked to accept a silly premise that these magic rings and the bad guy wearing them have existed for a thousand years. Nope. Just a dumb idea. One look at his gleaming and perfect thousand year old teeth and the whole thing falls apart. The film never recovers from that.

Next, there is the spectacularly bad directorial choice (from the aptly named Destin Cretton) to have all the actors in the film display no emotions with their faces whatsoever. As mentioned above, the sole exceptions are Awkwafina and Kingsley. Every other actor, AND ESPEICALLY PRETTY-BOY LEAD SIMU LIU, seems to be a star graduate from the Kristin Stewart school of blank stares. Boo. Maybe Cretton was going for Inscrutable, but all we see is Constipated.

The fight scenes are all generic karate video game stuff, boring at first glance, but unbearably dull after two hours. The music by Joel West is one blaring trumpet after another, so forgettable that I can't remember anything except constant boring noise.

The production design is wonderful, as we expect from Marvel: sets dripping in vivid color, crisp and exciting visuals, wonderful costumes. There are many beautiful and talented Asian actors on display here, but the script is so awful that I felt embarrassed for them. As I said, Awkwafina and Ben Kingsley save this film from being a complete flop, and their two performances are so wonderful that I am almost willing to let the rest of the garbage slide.

Almost."
Comedy or action movie?,"I wasn't sure if I was watching a childish comedy or action movie. I mean the first guardians of the galaxy had the perfect joke/serious mix in my opinion but this movie was constantly making me cringe and uncomfortable. The CGI was great but that is pretty much the only positive side of this movie in my opinion... In terms of story I was surprised there was no deeper background on where the rings actually came from, I'm not saying it needs to be in the movie but just something I missed.

I noticed a lot of people enjoyed this movie when I was in the theaters, so I am happy a lot of people actually enjoyed this movie. I guess marvel is not for me anymore.

This is MY opinion :)"
Asian Sensation!!,"As an Asian, this movie hit me in the feels hard...All the cast and team members did a stupendous job from visual effects to martial arts action. What else to expect from Marvel? Best movie of 2021 so far. 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏"
This movie is awesome,"This movie is awesome, i can't say one bad thing about it, the choreography is good, the writing is good, the.antagonist is good, everything is good!"
Showcases the best of Marvel,"Action packed and adventurous, a must-see. I look forward to seeing more of their stories and how they'll fit into the Marvel universe with other heroes."
"As a Chinese, I can tell this might be the best Asian-style Hollywood movie they have ever made","Tbh I really didn't have a lot of expectations going into this movie because I was disappointed with the stereotype multiple times but hell yea I absolutely LOVED this movie! (especially Hong Kong films martial arts prototype and the other fight choreography)

I have no doubt to these actor since I know them all (Awkwafina's role could be better). They did put a lot of effort into mythology although it's a bit weird. Well done marvel!"
Excellent,"I went in not knowing much about Shang-Chi or the ten rings for that matter. I wasn't expecting much but I was wrong, and I am glad I was. Great story, great cast and probably one of the best Marvel films done so far. Recommend taking the time out to see it if you are a fan of marvel/comic book movies/heroes."
Watch in theatres,"I am so glad theatres are open where I live and what a visual treat this movie is, from the characters to the battles and everything, This movies is a must watch in theatres (sorry for bad English)"
Money well spent,"Good work. Lots of money was given to the right people to create the right movie. From choreography, to story, to cinematography, nothing disappointed. Top 5 marvel movie for me HANDS DOWN."
Far better than expected,"I thought I'd like the film, but I didn't expect it to be one of my all-time favorite MCU movies! It's a mix of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and anything Jackie Chan. The action in this movie is as good as you've read, and easily the best action in any MCU film to date. Simu Liu is awesome, but the ending is so epic it's definitely worth the price of admission. As an English teacher I loved the self-aware reference to Macbeth, but the film does a fantastic job completing the hero's journey. Great job Marvel, you've done it yet again."
Beyond expectations,"When I thought this is just another marvel movies, Shang-Chi is beyond my expectation!"
no online streaming it's hard to watch during this pandemic,"Very satisfied when watching at the cinema, but still very difficult when watching it at home. At first I underestimated this film, I thought it would be bad, but I was totally wrong. A very good film, the CGI visual effects are very capable and rich. I will watch it for the 2nd time. 9/10 for me. I'm satisfied."
Shang chi saves 2021,"The movie provides an excellent experience for the whole family. One of the best, if not the best, origin stories in the MCU. Amazing cameos and mind-blowing action. This one is for any die-hard marvel lover or action seeker. The Actors produced some of the best on-screen performances we have ever seen in an MCU movie. Keep up the excellent work exciting times head for the super hero movie lovers."
Worst Marvel movie ever,
"After Black Panther, it's time for Asians to take centerstage!","Awesome! I enjoyed it a lot. Visually entertaining. This is the best from Marvel since the End Game!

Asians rule! I just wish they included more cast from North East and South East Asia! It would have been an even better representation!

10/10! A great labor day weekend movie treat!"
Visually perfect,"The movie was funny, full of action and very wel made. Will definitely watch it in the cinema again."
Solid movie!,Kudos Marvel for having the guts to make this film.
Fantastic story that pulled me in every step of the way,"I don't give 10/10 stars on most things but this was close. The thing that makes this different from a bunch of other superhero movies is that halfway through the movie I was already invested in the characters. Most origin movies focus on one or two characters to make you understand where they're coming from to prepare you for the sequel. But in this it was clear that the characters were all people with great depth. Comparing this to other marvel origin movies I would say that this one takes the cake, each and every one on one fight scene felt so tense and also like a dance. The cinematography was also brilliant, I could tell what characters were thinking and how they felt from angles and hue alone. I also really enjoyed how the movie wasn't all about Shang-Chi but it was also about all the other characters in his life and how they related to the situations they were in with him. With all this said I have to say that my favourite part was how invested I felt with several of the characters, I could understand the villains, Shang-Chi, and all the other main cast. They made it clear what they were thinking sometimes without any words, or saying something else.

Shang-Chi: welcome to the MCU, I am so excited to see what comes next."
Underestimated,I saw all the trailers and all the press for the movie but wasn't that hyped for it if I'm being honest. Then I saw the movie and I must say...expectations were blown out of the water. The movie was great and something quite unique and refreshing for the mcu. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and would recommend.
This is a master blaster.,I have witnessed something way beyond my expectations. This movie is fully action packed and well directed. Surely this is best part 1 movie of any franchise.
"Awesome, not a common ""Marvel""","As a Marvel hater I want to say this films is awesome, is not the terrible ""joke every 5 minutes"". I loved it, all the action and history is interesting."
Amazing movie,I really enjoyed the film. I thought that it was emotional just as it was funny and will most likely see again!
At its best when it's grounded,"The simple, well choreographed fights were FAR better than any CGI battle-mess which unfortunately took over the movie in the 3rd act. Decent characters and mediocre at-BEST lore make this a forgettable entry into the MCU."
0/10,"Makes no sense, áll the scenes took so long, if you don't count these useless long shots, the movie would take 30 minutes. Horrible."
The problem with this movie,"The problem with this movie is not that was that bad except few scenes , but was too boring - not interesting !"
Generally Not Recommending!,"Movie like this is way better to watch on streaming than on cinema, i'm actually regretting going to watch this. While Suicide Squad was at least something new for DC, Shang-Chi was absolutely nothing new for Marvel."
Loved it,"Movie was jam packed with great choreography , visual effects and story.

Some parts pacing was too slow but in general a great movie!"
"It's like a 80's kung-fu movie of old (well, mostly)",
What the actual f ***,"Do not watch this movie, i repeat - do not watch this movie. You will never get these 2 hours back. Do not believe the high ratings - they must be fake. I cannot even believe why someone would rate this anywhere near 10. This is far under 5 in my book. Jesus............"
1 for the comedy.,"First Marvel movie I've thought about walking out of. Sit through nearly 2 hours of over explanation and a very slow moving plot and then experience the warbling furry talking animal reminiscent of the porgs from Disney'd Starwars. The amount of high rated reviews is very suspicious. Definitely not the best marvel movie, only a couple of scenes even felt like a marvel movie."
Just my review,"Don't believe positive reviews that try to hype up this movie. Unlike them, i actually went to cinema to watch it and it was possibly most generic mcu movie i have ever seen. Just cause movie has some cool new visual effects, doesn't automatically mean it has depth or interesting characters."
One of the best move ever.,
Pretty decent watch,"Shang-Chi, the master of weaponry-based Kung Fu, is forced to confront his past after being drawn into the Ten Rings organization.

The film itself while not perfect was a really good watch and way more enjoyable then black widow.

Ben Kingsley was a lot better here then he was in Iron Man 3.

The acting was good.

The effects were cool.

I definitely recommend it."
"Lots to love, but feeling very formula","There are so many cool things about this movie, but they forgot to flesh out the characters a little bit. In particularly how Shang Chi even uses or gets his power. All of it very convenient and feels kinda manufactured for the purpose of having cool fights and special effects. Those however I will say are exceptional. And for and origin story it turned out pretty cool how they layered in the character development through out. Loved seeing something culturally and visually different. This was WAY better than Eternals."
Disappointed Marvel Fan,"I am a huge marvel fan. My kids young and old are all huge marvel/super hero fans. I have seen every marvel movie multiple times, and just finished binge watching all of them in chronological order again recently. This movie started out a little funny and felt like it was going to be a good action flick once the fight scene started in the bus, despite some iffy cgi and the guy with the machete hand. It didnt take too long to realize that was one of the few good scenes in the movie. Dont get me wrong the fight scenes are done nicely, but they seem to drawn out to long. It all just fell flat. This is the first marvel movie that I didnt make it to see in theaters.... I even made it to black widow. Im glad I didnt make it for this one. I was beyond bored with the drawn out fight scenes, some of which werent needed, and lack of engaging dialogue. I never once felt connected or invested in any one character. I ended up turning it turned if off a little more than half way through. I have never done that with a marvel movie, even if ive seen it a dozen times before. I may try again sometime but doubt it."
Was alright,
Legendary,
Beyond my expectations,"Such a beautiful movie, everything is great. I'm usually not a huge fan of fighting sequences, but let me tell you, this movie is different. Everything about Shang-Chi gets you hooked. The actors are doing a great job, and the storyline is just spectacular. It's like those crazy ideas you think of, before realizing it's a little too chaotic. This movie does that, but makes it good and executable. The only thing I'd change about the movie is the VFX. Don't get me wrong, they're quite the vision, but they don't look too realistic. All in all, still a solid 9/10."
Top notch,This movie has the best and fresh action scenes. Marvel never lets you down in terms of expactations. Loved it completely.
Best. Marvel. Movie. Yet.,"This movie had it all. It had great action and humor (which you would expect from a Marvel movie), but it was also so well-layered with complex characters, compelling themes, and respect for Asian culture. I found myself laughing and crying at this movie. I also loved the guest appearance from an old character long forgotten and some amazing creatures. This movie deserves all the praise it can get."
Paint by numbers superhero movie,"It was ok. Nothing new, but that's what Marvel does, churns out the same story over an over."
It's very entertaining,Visually it's one of the most interesting and amazing films from the MCU. But the script is really bad and poor.
JUST AMAZING,"Loved it all. The comedy, the story, the acting, the special effects. A new character of Marvel with a lot of potencial. Hope to see a lot more of this in next movies."
Entertaining but that's it - why the hype?,"This is a beautiful movie, and it is entertaining. However the plot could not be more basic and the characters development more limited to what they could fit in between action scenes. All of this alongside some quite weird choices as to make Shaun's friend an essential character to the development of the story for future movies when she has no reason to be part of it at all, other than for being a liability... so all in all, I had a good time at the movie, but that's it. I reserve my good notes for movies that really deserve them."
Good looking and good feeling movie.,"It was fun, beautiful, and different. Very watchable and rewatchable which is an important quality in action movies. Go see it while it's in the theater because it is a pretty set film best seen on the big screen."
The story is good but there is problems with other aspects of this movie.,"The best aspects of this movie is hand to hand combats(without the rings) and Simu Liu is awesome in it and embraces the character. The story is good if consider standalone which it is but I have problems with other aspects of movie elements. The entire movie is shooted in closed studio environment with huge set pieces (Marvel is doing such things for last many movies e.g, the last 2 Avengers movies). It is very very very stupid to look at and the non sensical vfx. Still remember the first Iron man movie in which the original and vfx elements are hard to distinguish and have had a good balance in reality and fantasy world. The movie is forcing the humours too in some cases. In some case they tried to mimic Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. This movie certainly have some asian vibe in movie making style but I think there were manipulation in making by studio over creator. The music of the movie is good. Overall it's a good movie. I am going to give any special attention for other upcoming marvel movies( Maybe because I left behind my fantasy world). I think there will not be any 'Classic' from marvel in upcoming future."
A different kind of Marvel movie,Was a great time. A lot of action. Very good story. It's a different feel than other Marvel movies.
End-of-your-seat actions,"Saw this on opening night and it was soooo worth it! Amazing fighting sequences and choreography, amazing cinematography, amazing acting (especially by legendary Tony Leung), and the storyline is interesting and moving. Lots of LOL moments and surprise guest appearances. I rarely pay the $15 to see a movie in the theater but this one I will do again!"
"Beautiful, imaginative, and refreshing.","The action, martial arts, and cinematography is top-notch. I find myself nodding in awe and saying ""wow"" in many scenes. I'm left craving for more action. I love the idea of power being combined with skill. The martial arts element really adds creativity and a whole new world of moves and skills open up. It's not a bunch of powerful people throwing out nonstop blasts or a strong thing throwing brute punching left and right.

The world is beautiful. The musical guides you. The tone filled with art and symbolism. Beautiful all around. And shoutout to Ronny Chieng! Seeing him make an appearance was pretty funny.

With some of the weaker elements I will have to point to the pacing. There were a few moments that felt dragged out or unnecessary. Some screen time was given to certain characters that didn't need it and they should focus a little more time on certain relationships.

Overall I enjoyed the movie and lot and was left craving for more."
"Magic, rings and comedy 😍",
Fantastic Movie,"I finally took the plunge and went to cinema for the first time since 2019. The movie was highly entertaining with engaging characters and a good story too. The action and fights scenes seemed very well choreographed and the special effects were a joy to experience on the big screen.

It was a Marvel film that didn't feel like a Marvel film, which shows how versatile the MCU is becoming.

I was highly impressed to see and hear characters speak in their native language, a risk as many people don't like to read subtitles, but being an avid fan of Asian cinema I was quite happy and comfortable to do so.

Overall, a highly entertaining and fun film from Marvel.

I highly recommend it. A+++"
Awsome Screen,"Really nice concept with great Direction, teams work & VFX. I really enjoy the movie 🤗"
"Fun, Exciting, Culture Rich","Its was great, finally after so long we got to experience good origins story. I know kevin feige will nailed it even after lot of people thought its gonna flop.

The movie is like a mixture between western and eastern culture afterall the protagonist is an asian living in american.

The raw choreography is the best in the MCU, better than Winter Soldier. The CGI fights is not bad but i think they should do more of the raw realistic fight scene more because its the most appealing part of the movie.

Tony Leung is so charismatic even if he is a villain, i can feel sympathetic to his character. The new mythology is cool, the fantastic beast is awesome too I hope we can see a sequels."
It was more than I expected!,"As an Asian-American, I am no stranger to the cliche martial art scenes and corniness of it all. I went in fully expecting everything about this movie to be cheesy and cliche like Mulan was. Boy, was I wrong! Shang-Chi was so beautifully written, acted, and directed! I really want to give a huge shout out to the directors for their incorporation of Asian culture into this movie without making everything a cliche or a punch-line. I teared up watching people who looked like me be the main actors on a big screen and not the punch-line of a joke.

Now, onto the story, the story was alright. It wasn't the best, but it's an introductory movie to the hero so not much to expect there other than your typical hero introductory tropes.

The OST's of this movie were off the charts! I really enjoyed the music they had and think they nailed it.

Need I say more about the acting? Tony Leung, Sima Liu, Awkwafina, Michelle Yeoh...These are the best of the best for Asian American actors and they nailed every scene they had in the movie!

Lastly, I absolutely loved the cinematography and the fight scenes. They were well thought out and choreographed. It didn't seem cheesy or corny. Thank you Marvel for making this movie and paying homage to Asian Americans. This movie will be one that I will never forget!"
"Overhyped, Better than Average MCU Movie.",
Beautifully stunning action story tale,"As a huge fan of the IP Man and Marvel movies I feel that this movie was a beautiful balance between insane action and beautiful backdrops and wonderful mystical powers. Growing up watching old-school kung fu movies and then finding superhero movies on my own and loving them, I feel this movie is a perfect blend of everything I want from modern action cinema."
Best Solo Origin Movie After Dr. Strange,"Watched it yesterday. Overall the movie was wonderful. MCU put everything so perfectly. The cast, visuals, CGI everything was on pinpoint. Every Characters performance was brilliant. I need to mention this because without this character the movie would not be that interesting and that role is played by Awkwafina as Katy. Her comic timing was so good. And as always marvel surprised me to have the villain as Tony Chiu-Wai Leung as as Xu Wenwu. His performance was brilliant along with our new hero Simu Liu as Shang Chi.

Definitely worth of time. Go watch the movie in the theatre and don't spoil."
Favorite Marvel origin film yet,"Shang-Chi was BEYOND my expectations. Some of the best acting, fight choreography, and visual effects I've seen from Marvel in a while. The story itself had so much heart."
New realm of marvel entertainment,"If you are a fan of the character, you will love it, marvel is opening up to new realms and its going to be intense... next up eternals let's go!!!"
Superb,"Absolutely fantastic! Just don't miss it on big screen, i'd say. Moderation of comedy punches, action and katy has my 💕heart! Superb!!!!!!"
Absolutely Amazing,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, it was so awesome. Definitely recommend seeing it in the theater. Watch through the credits, there's two Post-Credit Scenes!"
Absolutely Amazing!,"I can't express to you how amazingly beautiful this movie is. You need to watch it for yourself! Excellently choreography, awesome blend of humor, drama and action. I was beginning to think there was no place for martial artists in marvel after iron fist, I was proved wrong. Hopefully we get several more 👍👍"
Best movie of 2021 so far.,"Awesome fights.

Awesome graphics.

Awesome music.

Awesome 👍 movie.

Music & fight sequences are the best.

Personally second best solo hero movie of Marvel after Ironman."
I loved this movie,Great story and it's totally worth seeing it was one of the best marvel movies i have ever seen.
Not disappointed,So far one of the best movies that I have seen in recent years. One of my 10 tops.
A true action fantasy movie,This movie is very amazing. The special effect and martial arts stunt are very beautiful. This is one the best movie from Marvel. A must to see the movie 2 times.
Shang-Chi - SATs Hero Movie!,"The movie was so in point - from the standard parent reference around doing better, around the typical girls and boys can't be friends they must get married at some point the the we can be responsible orrrrrr...

Honestly - this has hit me on another level with how relative to our culture it is! So well done - so authentic to marvel!!! And it's just the beginning!!!!!!!!"
Best movie ever!!,"One of my favourite marvel movies, can't get over how good it was. Simu Liu ( Shang-chi himself) did such an amazing job along with the rest of the cast."
Go Watch It!,
Best Movie of MCU,First review ever. All I have to say is you need to see the phenomenon for yourself.
Spectacular,"The story telling, the act of Tony Leung, the Chinese elements this time are really authentic and didn't make me feel weird for I believe the very first time from watching the Hollywood movie, whether it's the creatures, family relationships, even the language speaking this time is really legit. This is such a great movie."
I really like the movie,I went to the cinema with 0 hype and i get impressed.
Really enjoyed!,"Top 5 Marvel movies for me. I loved the action and fight scenes, music, cinematography and set colors, and the humor. I genuinely liked the main characters and rooted for them. It's 100% worth seeing! I want to see it a second time."
Fun Night at the Movies!,"Smart, Funny, and Beautiful, hits the right strings with a good pace. Awkwafina's Katy really grows in the film and grows on you. Solid performances from legendary Yeoh and Leung. Although most of the movie it's easy to forget it's in the MCU, Fun callback to a previously thrown away character and also a nice bridge to known elements of the MCU. Plenty of new fare for figuring out the next phase of the MCU (and multiverse?). Two end credit scenes so stick around."
Great!,This was a great movie. I really enjoyed it from start to finish.
"Soo good, especially the soundtrack","The movie was very good, especially the soundtrack!! It was unique unlike other marvel movies which has a generic soundtrack. Highly recommend yall watch this in theaters."
Good,"Good film. There were some places that seemed superfluous or unnecessary, but this did not affect the fact that the film is wonderful!"
Worst Marvel film,If this is considered a good Marvel movie then Marvel is in big trouble. Completely unoriginal.
...and just when you think you've seen all that Marvel has to offer...,"Marvel, you sneaky SOBs, is there nothing - I mean NOTHING at all - that you can't turn your hands to? I'll be the first to admit that I was very sceptical about what really amounts to a glorified Kung Fu movie finding its place in the MCU. I need not have worried. Shang Chi sits right up there with the very best Marvel has on show.

Simu Liu and the ever wonderful Akwafina make a fantastic duo and the addition of the queenly Michelle Yeo and the wonderful Tony Leung is the icing on the cake. It's exciting, adventurous fun. So go see it, you definitely won't regret it!"
One of the best films Marvel as ever made!,
ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT!!!!!,"This film...is just brilliant without spoilers there's not much for me to say.

Overall 9/10."
Would Recommended,The movie had a generic story but Really cool cinematography and fighting choreography with a couple references to some classic kung fu movies. Acting was good overall with some beautiful synergy between some characters.
My eyes couldn't handle the sheer awesomeness on the screen,"Watch this in IMAX!!!! The entire movie has an expanded aspect ratio. You're watching about 70% of the image on normal screens, plus on way smaller screens with worse speakers. I promise, it's worth it.

WOWOWOWOWOW. This movie blew me away. I love it. A LOT. From beginning to end. Everything. I walked out of the movie so hyped, silent-screaming under my mask as I walked to the car. It's been a while since I walked out of a movie this happy. I have so much to say.

I love the MCU (a lot), but there are a few things that are frequently lacking. One of them is good fight scenes. They always have awesome action scenes, but specifically fight scenes are usually pretty good, only great in a few movies like Civil War and Winter Soldier. And for the most part, fight scenes in American movies pale in comparison to Asian cinema (Ip man, The Raid Redemption, anything Jackie Chan).

The fight scenes in this movie.... how do I describe it... amazing martial arts that's fast but clear, filmed in creative and astonishing ways without a hint of shaky cam or quick cuts, against stunningly beautiful backdrops... phenomenal. And they continuously focus on the fights instead of cutting to a different scene after 5 seconds like I've noticed in the MCU.

This is BY FAR the best fighting in the MCU and it's not even close. It has to be up there with the John Wick series and Netflix's Daredevil as some of the best we've seen in America lately. I loved the first major fight scene so much that I was worried it would be the best one of the movie, far too early. Lol. I be stupid sometimes. They're all amazing.

Another frequent flaw in the MCU is lack of compelling villain. Nope. The villain has full depth with clear motivations you can sympathize with. Cool, charismatic, intimidating, and formidable. Everything you want in a villain.

Another area of improvement is the musical scores. Most of them don't stand out. I think they learned. They're on a good streak with the shows and Black Widow. And now this. Not only is it a great score, it fits perfectly in the movie and the individual scenes/moments. It's not as amazing as the Loki score but it definitely elevated the movie. It feels unique to this new franchise.

Still so much more to say, need to go faster. This is one of the best, maybe THE best, story in the MCU, especially the way it's told. Flashbacks can slow down a movie, but here they are some of the best scenes.

I loved all the characters, I loved all the casting choices, I loved the performances. There are scenes of dialogue that gave me goosebumps. All the emotional moments hit. All the callbacks hit. There isn't anything that didn't work for me. It fires on all cylinders.

Lmao I didn't mention the cinematography. Why would I wait this long? It's MESMERIZING. A lot. Throughout. It's candy for your eyes.

It's also nice to see well-written comedy with jokes relevant to the scene and characters. It feels organic. As opposed to the ""insert joke here"" method we've been seeing more of, especially in Far From Home.

What's the opposite of formulaic? That's this movie. I never knew what to expect next (helps that I didn't watch a single trailer, they ruin movies). Definitely doesn't feel like a typical MCU movie. It has it's own unique tone and feel and character.

Continuing what I said in my headline, I have this thing where I get goosebumps and start tearing up, not from an emotional moment, but from a scene being so incredible, especially action scenes. I don't know why it happens, don't know if it happens to other people. Maybe it's partly because I can't risk blinking. That happened in this movie numerous times. Like, ""this is the coolest thing I've ever seen in my life."" Hyperbole, but mannnnn.

After Endgame (basically) finished phase 3, I was so happy and satisfied with the MCU. But I wasn't sure they could ever recapture that magic again. I knew I would watch everything and it would probably mostly be awesome. But I wasn't expecting top-tier stuff any more. Lol. I be stupid sometimes. I am ecstatic to have that notion obliterated. As of now, this is a top 6 MCU movie for me. Wow.

All in all, I adore this movie. You may wonder why I wouldn't give it a 10 after all this raving. 10s are super rare for me, only 13 of them, and I watch thousands of movies. Interstellar, Inception, Mad Max Fury Road, etc. Movies that shouldn't even be called movies. My 9s are rare too, they are my favorite movies. 10s are my favorites of my favorites. The only superhero movies I've given 10s are The Dark Knight, The Dark Knight Rises and Civil War.

If you're still reading, wow you're awesome! I think this is my longest review other than Interstellar.

I'm still in such a good mood. I can't wait to watch it again, in IMAX. I want to wait a week so it feels fresher, but I might not be able to! (4 viewings, opening Thursday 9/2/2021, 9/5/2021, 9/22/2021, 3/26/2022)"
Marvel Goes Full Kung-Fu,
"Martial Arts, Mythology and Magic.","A super smooth blend of magic, martial arts and mythology. The chemistry between the two leads is spot on and it's hilarious. Some of the best choreographey in the MCU and a really memorable villain. If you want the full experience, watch in a cinema and I'd personally recommend watching Iron Man 3 first."
Watch it.,"Go an watch this movie in theaters.. the story,effects,action, comedy,acting everything are awesome. PS : and you will get 2 post credit scenes."
Might have been a generous 7.5,"... but the previews ruined every single plot point.

When will they learn??"
Visual Chinese Martial Arts Masterpiece,"I'm a sucker for a good quality martial arts fight scene, and this has many of them. Every one is perfect. The movie has humor, heart, and really amazing fight scenes. I love the visual effects, the tradition and culture of the rich Chinese people, it overall just worked and I'm so excited to go see it for a second time."
Excellent,"Probably the best MCU origin movie since Gaurdians. Great martial arts action too. No shaky cam! The fight scenes are reminiscent if the older Jackie Chan movies of the 90s, which makes sense since his choreographer and crew worked on this movie."
"Definite 10 of 10! At the very top tier of MCU movies - characters, lore, acting, action, fighting, visual effects! :-)","The entire cast was perfect, especially Simu Liu, Awkwafina, Tony Leung, Michelle Yeoh, Ben Kingsley, and Ronny Chieng! :-) Spectacular visual effects -and- awesome fight scenes! :-)"
Fun!,
Very Chinese propaganda,"Very Chinese propaganda movie , the man has eternal power and living through the ages still the only thing on his mind is America hayaaa such a lizard."
MCUs weakest link,"Easily the worst MCU movie. It was celarly made in a way to suck-up to chinese market and has 0 originality we used to get from MCU. Weak story, full of overblown efects and martial arts is a balet here. Childish elements too. In hollywoods ambition to prostitute themselves to market where they can make most money from the tickets - they abandoned true Marvel fans and created a good night story for children with nothing but cheap emotions."
What a Comeback,
"Very good, but...",
Ignore the 1* reviews. This is so much better than they're saying.,
A KNOCK OUT WIN FOR MARVEL!!!!!!,"This is not a superhero movie. This is a very entertaining and well acted Chinese film. A MUST SEE ABSOLUTELY WORTH YOUR TIME AND MONEY...

My Grade: A."
A great introduction,"A great introduction to a new Mcu hero, great marvel humor and can not wait to see more. They did the back story justice with this fresh take on the 10 rings."
The same but different,"When watching Shang- Chi you will almost immediately see that it follows the same formula as every other marvel movie, but there is one thing that this movie excels at and that is the choreography. The choreography is some of the best seen in the the marvel universe and maybe even in cinema in general. The character of Shang- chi (played by Simu Liu) is a great addition to the MCU, but I can not say the same for some of the other characters in the movie especially the character Katy.(played by Awkwafina). The character is very flat and childish making her almost annoying though I believe that this is the fault of the writers and not Awkwafina. Another aspect of this movie that I like is the cameos, while I will not mention them to avoid spoilers, I will say that they are definitely one of my favorite parts of not only this movie but of the MCU in general. All in all I give Shang-chi a 9 out of 10. Great movie."
Phase 4 here we come,"My expectations for this movie was low, maybe it's due to the fact that there wasn't much hype around it but men it delivered awesomely."
Best movie ever,This movie was perfect. Allot of action plus allot of comedy. This is the funniest marvel movie ever. Also the storyline is pretty good. Considering that this movie used to be a comic and now it's a movie it's pretty good and they did a good job on it.
Jackie Chan meets Donnie Yen meets Captain America,
Just ehh,The dialogue is terrible no really big character development. Fight scenes were fantastic though but everything else really wasn't that good.
Disappointing,"I'll start with the strong part of the movie and that is it's visuals. The visuals are dynamically spotless. If I keep it simple then the movie is a complete cinematic experience. If you are going for the big screen experience then you shouldn't miss it.

Now, except the cinematic experience. The movie lacks everywhere in terms of constructive and moving story telling. We only get to see incident after incidents and sometimes few of them doesn't make sense or felt forced as a scene.

Lastly I'll say the movie didn't fall into my taste of movies since I'm more into strong story telling than breathtaking visuals. Anyhow, I good one time forgettable watch."
An enjoyable ride throughout.,""" If you aim at nothing, you get nothing ""

Shang chi gets most of the part right with crazy action choreography which is undoubtedly the major attraction. First act is racy and has crazy action episodes and later, the recurring flashbacks served the story purpose but at the same time, slightly hindered the flow. Not a big issue though as the action part kicks in and makes up for it. Third act ten rings action visuals are pretty damn good and the water formation is breathtaking which reminded me of Raya.

New guy "" Simu Liu "" owned the Shang chi role, as his efforts are clearly visible on the screen. Especially during action episodes , he nailed it with his quick reflexes, even Meng'er Zhang as Chi's sister did put up an impressive act and Awkwafina provided a bit of humor with her quirky attitude . Fala Chen is so beautiful, i fell head over heels for her smile. The man, Tony Leung stood tall and delivered with panache, his presence worked big time. Always love to see Michelle Yeoh on the screen , she got that aura which pulls me in. Trevor and Morris stole the show, loved their bonding :)

Over all , with couple of surprises , good performances , amazing score , striking visuals and top notch action pieces makes this one an enjoyable ride throughout. Had a good time at the cinemas. Simu Liu is a fine addition to the MCU. Easily deserves solid 7-7.5 rating !!

First post credit scene is whistle worthy moment , JUST WOW!!!"
Cringe worthy,Seriously Marvel wtf?? Why is it so difficult for you to make a good movie??? What's wrong??? Classless and tasteless as always. Why is it so bad why is it so bad???? Why do you keep on disappointing us like this.
Entertaining,"It's an entertaining fantasy, action and adventure film. It has beautiful backdrops, settings, and costumes. The martial arts ballet and fighting has excellent choreography. The cinematography was colorful with strong compositions and it flowed well from action scenes to action scenes.

Awkwafina is funny and she provided the needed comedy relief. The story was a little busy for my taste but it still worked. The CGI was good but expected from a Marvel/Disney film."
Watchanle but opportunity missed.,"Ten Rings or is it Ten Bracelets? I will leave the research for you and the Marvel fans debate, and how accurate this movie is to the orignal comics. Focusing on this movie I must say it was flat right through until we get to the magical lands. Cultural mythical accuracy is sadly pushed aside by the writers and animators to retain a very standard plot. Characters' poor dialogues didnt help but the odd joke rarely did succeed. And I was very disappointed that there was a very poor attempt to capture the classical and contemporary Kung Fu element in the fights - it was limited and opportunity largely missed. If this movie was not apart of the next grandeur Marvel phase, I would have not be surprised to see another attempt/ reboot in five or ten years."
A very weal MCU movie,"I really dont get why this movie gets all this praise..... It starts fine with some fine marshall arts and a drop of humor. Then its slows down on to exposition hell for a while full hour, before it rounds of with a weak climax

One of the weakest MCU movies together with Black widow, Thor 2, Antman.2 and The hulk if it counts."
True Disappointment,"Fighting coreographies are really good, music is perfect. The rest is awful."
1 hr of great martial arts then 1hr of rubbish,"Shang Chi what can I say other than the first hour was enjoyable with the whole backstory of the two siblings and the origins of the ten rings and its rival clan, the martial arts was also great.....but then it did what I was afraid it would do in the 2nd half of the movie and that was become a poor version and knock off of crouching tiger hidden, with silly wire work and theatrics that makes it out of place that it was like two different movies got cut and stitched together."
Average,"I really liked the actors they casted for this movie but I felt they did not focus enough on developing the characters rather than just throwing a bunch of CGI at you. The CGI was some of the best I've seen don't get me wrong, but it heavily shadowed the most important part of any movie: the plot. More time needed to be put into that aspect and the amazing Marvel CGI will follow. Seems to be a trend with some Marvel movies, just making it really boring when you go deeper than surface level."
excellent for a marvel movie,I dont enjoy marvel movies anymore but this plot was enjoyable since it wasnt as predictable.
Good story 👍,Shang chi and the legend of ten rings i good can help Marvel's 4th phase to get better.
Bland paint by numbers,Typical bland crap from Marvel. Generic and paint by numbers. This movie does nothing to be special. It was boring and honestly exactly what you should expect from Marvel at this point.
Movie made for martial arts fans and Chinese,"To clear out the reviews fight. I believe that the situation is like this:

If you love martial arts you will love this film. If you are Chinese you will probably like it, and even more if you live outside China.

If you are a huge Marvell fan you will like this movie or at least tolerate it.

All the rest will probably be disappointed.

It is still a Marvell film, and the quality is good. The story is less good, and at many points loses any common sense even for a ""superheroes"" movies that initially lack any sense. Marvell could do better at least with the story."
Beautiful!,"I just simply love how beautiful this movie is! The actions, the visual, everything!"
A total frustration,"Marvel productions are anything but boring. The film had good representation of the Chinese culture and good visuals, but the plot was very indirect, full of gaps and unexplained things, shallow characterising. It's a certain thing until it turns out to be something else the next second. Quick shifts in the plot. A bit of forced comedy too, and the lack of interesting hooks. This is a Marvel disappointment."
The Marvel formula done right,"An incredible MCU film. It offers nothing too cerebral, but that is not the main focus of the film. The comedy, the action, the themes, the choreography and the vibrant visuals make this film a standout among similar standalone Marvel films, while the layered and truly epic soundtrack is the finishing touch. While some of the effects and the pacing perhaps could have been a little more polished, and the final battle had some weaknesses, this is a colourful, emotional and fun rollercoaster of a film. Tony Leung is by far the standout member of the cast, delivering a captivating and even sympathetic villain. Simu Liu holds his own, but needs more time to really shine as a new Marvel superhero-while Meng'er Zhang, Awkwafina and Fala Chen are integral to this film's effectiveness. Overall, this fun and touching movie is an exemplar of the 'Marvel formula' and its strengths."
An below average marvel film,"This film had some very funny and unique moments in it, but overall I think the story was quite weak and there weren't any moments where I was fully into the movie. I think sequels could have good potential but I left the cinema without much excitement. Don't get me wrong it's a good movie but there are so many marvel films that top this one in storyline and character developed ect. I think 6 is a reasonable score I would give 6.5 if this were an option but 7 is a bit generous. Don't believe these 10/10 reviews. 10 is reserved for cinematic masterpieces like the dark night or infinity war."
A bright start to the new phase of Marvel Studios!,"Marvel has started its new era, which will be interesting for their old fans and will attract the attention of new audience. The film's director, Deston Creton, did a good job. Perfectly selected cast of actors who have done their tasks for 100%. They understand their characters and clearly convey their emotions. Gorgeous costumes and Joel West's soundtracks, with Chinese motives, aptly create an atmosphere of a magical world we haven't seen before. I won't say anything bad about the script either. I didn't mantion any plot holes, and the bonus was good jokes and a touching and sometimes tragic family story. Bill Pope's balanced shots and amazing special effects, which have definitely reached a new level, also go to the film's pluses. A special tribute to the director of the fights Andy Chang. Clear movements and dynamic music make such scenes a real spectacle. This film is worth your attention.

My rating is 8.5 / 10."
Decent story. Final action sequences outstanding,"Generally speaking, the story has nothing special to me, but still good and solid. What I really find outstanding are many of the action scenes. The action and CGI in the final act are amazing, definitely one of the best in the entire MCU.

I'd like to point out the soundtrack, it's really good."
Worse MCU ever,
BEST movie of 2021,"Easily the best movie on 2021 , and the best MARVEL movie I've watched.

Very colorful , Non stop action! Impressive movie that will mesmerize you! Truly loved it."
No good writer left in Hollywood huh?,
A very well made kung-fu action movie with the MCU,"The best thing about this movie is that the filmmakers really understood what makes kung-fu action movies so good. The way their shot and edited. With longer takes, few cuts and wider angles. So that we can completely take in and appreciate the action is it takes place.

I didn't give this a 10, just because some of the CGI is very obvious and fake. Otherwise, it's a good story, that's well told, with excellent cinematography and fight choreography. What else can you ask for from a kung-fu movie?"
Best Marvel Movie Masterpiece,"Unreal. I've seen them all and this one is by far the best I've seen.

Spectacular action and visuals unlike any other Marvel feature film.

Highly recommend if you don't even like superhero movies. This is in another level."
GREAT ORIGIN STORY,"Shang Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings is a great and spectacular movie that expands the MCU in many ways. It has plenty of memorable action, emotional and comedy sequences, with convincing characters and breathtaking fight choreographies and CGI. Shang Chi is a familiar but exciting superhero's origin story, that explores a new cultural ground in the MCU.

Rating: 7,9."
Easily the worst aspect of the movie is the writing,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of The Ten Rings is directed by Destin Daniel Cretton. The movie centres around the Ten Rings Organisation, which is lead by Shang-Chi's father, who is a man that has been consumed by power and greed for thousands of years. This movie received so much praise, with many claiming this is one of the best instalments in the MCU. However after seeing the film, I have to say I was extremely disappointed. Easily the worst aspect of the movie is the writing. Almost every plot point occurs for no reason but to simply give the audience a purposeless action sequence or provide an exposition dump. To give an example, Shang-Chi's father sends his men to fight his children and we don't have any idea why. The action is cool to look at, and after three lengthy sequences it turns out he just wants them to return to his organisation. We find this out because the father shows up after all the pointless fights, and they just willingly go with him. Couldn't he have just shown up at the start of the movie? Like that would have been way more efficient for him. Basically the entire movie follows this trend. Even the fact that he wants his kid's help makes no sense. He didn't actually need them. He has the ten rings and an entire army to fight with. Like I get he needed their pendants to reveal a confusing useless map for 3 seconds, but couldn't he have taken the necklaces then left them alone? All this is really unfortunate because the execution of some action sequences are so great. Like Shang-chi's fight with his sister. I love hand to hand combat. But there was no purpose behind the fight. It's like someone just put the scene in because the movie got boring. Unfortunately, the movie does not end on a high either. I sat there having to stare at awful green screen and so much CGI, I couldn't help but laugh at it. Overall I thought this movie was watchable but extremely disappointing. There was potential to make a great film here, but to me it felt like marvel did not care about the script."
Not a good movie but a great one,"Settled in to watch this with no expectations.

The martial arts is awesome! The scenery is spectacular.

Not a dull moment In it.

I suggest watching this with the family.

My kids loved it.

My son is 8 and he wants to be a ninja now."
MUST WATCH,"As someone who loves the marvel brand and is skeptical about its future regarding political messaging, this was a pleasant surprise. If the new Phase 4 Marvel movies are of the same quality I'll be very delighted to sit back and watch what else Marvel brings to the table for viewers."
Made for China Marvel,"Yet another Marvel movie, but with a new mystique story, which is most entertaining. Parts are in Mandarin, so be prepared to read the English translation. The story and visual scenes are well done specifically because it contains a lot of CGI. The martial art scenes are likewise well choreographed, almost looking like a dance routine. More Ten Ring movies are in the offing."
A good time,"Watching this movie was kind of a roller coaster, it would pick up then slow down, then pick up and slow down again, but it was an enjoyable movie at the end of the day."
Amazing,"Waited for cinemas to open from lockdown, and this movie was amazing to watch on the big screen. The story is great, the actors fit perfectly, the action scenes are crazy good. The camera movement in the film in fight scenes is absolutely phenomenal!"
SOLID WEAPON IN MCU ARSENAL,"Lot of MCU movies are visual feast but this movie is just on whole another level.

They explored and mastered almost every aspect of superhero trait only thing they left was Kung-Fu this movie fills that void with added Asian tinge.

Lot of credit to casting director.

With so many speculations on post credit scene this character can be used in any mainstream MCU movie.

It has everything MCU movie has comedy, breathtaking action sequences, music, screenplay, that father element.

This movie also has that one thing which majority of MCU movies lack like a good storyline.

Definitely End Game isn't end of MCU."
Shang-Chi,"Sorry, this was a bag of mixed blessings for me Despite some great cinematic moments, it felt like that Marvel is moving towards movies like the SW The Last Jedi category, and I really did not like the Katty character."
A fun fantasy action movie,"I really enjoyed this movie. The fantasy elements were well placed, the comedy was well timed and the fight scenes were really fun to watch. Even the villain make some sense."
As Close to Perfect as Possible,"This is the most visually stunning film in the Marvel universe. It features the most impressive physical fight scenes yet in the cannon. But most of all the plotline and script are faultless - a perfectly balanced epic journey. The performances are pitch perfect. It's a chic, fantastical juggernaut, with exquisite heart. I'm going to return to it time and time again, simply because of how enjoyable and entertaining it is. I cannot wait for the next Shang-chi film! Wow!! LOVE THIS STORY!! Fantastic! I hope they re-release this in theatres when the second film comes out because it would be phenomenal on the big screen."
One of the best MCU entries so far,
Kind of terrible.,"Bad acting. Generic boring Marvel story. Nothing but CGI and not their best effort with CGI either.

This is in the Captain Marvel, Thor 2, Iron Man 2 & 3, etc range.

I'm sure his character will be more fun when they have a team up movie or the next Avengers movie but this was mediocre and the 4 rating is also effective by the hype and praise this movie received. I don't get it at all."
Amazing,"I missed real kung fu so much!!

Despite if every MARVEL fantasy, the fight was incredible and exceeded my expectations.

I didn't know about this story of the comics, I'm very satisfied and curious to know more."
Fabulous,Absolutely loved this film. Fabulous from start to finish. Can't wait for the next one. The acting and the story was ace. The special affects was amazing. Love love love it.
A good skeleton with too much fat,"I'll make this very brief:

If it wasn't for the stupid. Tacked-on Marvel silliness, the lazy writing and this ""actress"" ""Awkwafina"", this would have been a potentially nice film.

The action is a bit slow for Hong Kong style, but great in choreography and composition, the CGI extensive and sometimes obvious and tiresome.

The plot isn't great, but has some nice aspects to it - too bad that the film wasn't bold enough to follow through, and too bad that ""Awkwafina"" ruined every scene she was in.

The score was decent, if a bit generic, but better than average for 2021 and Marvel in general.

All in all, this was enjoyable nonsense with lots of cringe, but also lots of great stuff. If they would have focussed more on the characters and less on the fat around them, it would have been much better.

Please, Disney, get better writers."
Overated,"Nice visual but awkward acting, not so wow. Storyline was really good but Simu Liu as Shang Chi was not a great choice. I thought it was a good movie, but actually a bit of disappointed."
It was an okay movie,
Marvels most Soulful movie,"This is a beautiful movie; visual and filled with soul. Although it's your standard Marvel stop-the-bad-guys film, that aspect is overshadowed by the great family story. The ""villain"" has purpose that makes you resonate with his desire - and the actor delivers that perfectly. Entire cast is great. Awkwafina is the normal person thrown into the foray , Simu Liu might be a newcomer for most but as a Toronto resident, I'm bias and rooting for him. Film is clean, great for family. And for those long time Marvel cinematic watchers, yes it does tie into the big picture."
Love it!,Definitely worth the ticket! Great action and fight plots.
Actually quite a well-done movie,"Wasn't expecting much due to the recent Black Widow experience, but was fairly surprised by the quality of this film. The storyline is still the cliche origin story, but this one has good action sequences, good character building, good exploration into the core ideas of our culture, good representation of some of the mythical beens in it, actors speaking actual Mandarin Chinese not some weird ones with alien accents that Hollywood used to think is Chinese. Phase 4 of MCU looks a bit more promising after this. A solid 6 for pass.

1 more star for Leung Chiu-Wai, this is one of those where the ""villain"" is more likeable than the protagonist. Without his performance this whole thing would have been so mundane."
"Good martial art fight scenes, but that's it","The martial art scenes that aren't full of cgi are beautiful and a nice tribute to old cinema. But after that it breaks down. It's a predictable cgi fest, with mediocre characters.

I thought Awakafina was great, everyone else was average. Though it was meant to be a martial arts superhero film, it ended up just a marvel film.

I enjoyed it. But it was forgettable, and sorry to mention it again but the cgi got on my nerves. The dragons and stuff where ok cgi but got repetitive.

Overall worth watching, but noting special. Except the martial arts where beautiful."
"A good first half, but then it fails","This is a good movie I'm not denying that -- there's amazing CGI, good music and a very promising premise. For the first half the movie does great. But the second half seems very weak. The characters start making whimsical decisions and the story starts feeling very rushed. I really wish they could have kept it together though. The movie was slower than most Marvel movies and I was liking that fact too."
Excellent 👌,"Absolutely enjoyed the film from first to last.... truly aa blockbuster.

Must watch film... At another blockbuster from Marvel studios."
A definite watch!,"This movie had amazing visuals, awesome fight scenes, and great and lovable characters. All in all this movie is very enjoyable and should be experienced on the big screen."
In a word: Stunning.,"Shang-Chi will likely be heralded as the ""Chinese Black Panther,"" but in truth, this is the film Black Panther wants to be when it grows up. Easily top-5 in the MCU, and probably competes with Guardians of the Galaxy for my favorite of the bunch.

There are several nods to the wider universe, and if you're a die-hard fan, they'll be quite rewarding, but they never distract from this mostly self-contained story.

This movie is at times seriously, laugh-out-loud funny, but it never falls into the trap of allowing humor to undermine its emotional moments. Ben Kingsley and Awkwafina give particularly standout performances. And if the latter's, shall we say, overt comedic style can get grating for you, know that not only does she deliver it in small doses, but she also has some surprisingly heartfelt moments, too.

Perhaps the most spectacular feature of this movie is its stuntwork. There are multiple incredibly long, exceedingly well-choreogrphed fight scenes. There are some which are the most creative, crazy, acrobatic fights since Jackie Chan's glory days in Hong Kong Cinema. Others take clear inspiration from the dance-like wirework of Wuxia films like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, even borrowing one of its lead actors for one of them. Throughout, the camerawork is clear, without the rapid-fire cutting that pervades much of Hollywood. The cinematography at times takes wide angles to really showcase, rather than mask, its stunt performers. At other times, the cameraman is treated as another performer, right in the heart of the acrobatic choreography.

While the the practical stunts will get lots of attention, the visual effects are just as beautiful, taking full advantage of the blockbuster budget. There are elemental effects that prove that a live-action Avatar: The Last Airbender movie could work. There are creatures that range from cute, cuddly animals to monsters that would make Kaiju films jealous. This movie even pulls off the difficult trick of making energy-based sci-fi weapons seem raw and visceral.

In the center of all this spectacle is a surprisingly resonant personal story about a broken family. Tony Leung gives an incredible performance, making a millenia-old, super-powered warlord not just sympathetic, but even relatable. The titular character embodies one of the film's central themes of bringing together aspects of disparate influences to forge a unique identity. The other lead has a similar story, but hers is arguably even more compelling.

All in all, Shang-Chi is a film that does just about everything right, and it does so while bringing its own fresh take, not just to the MCU, but to Hollywood filmmaking in general. They really knocked it out of the park with this one."
"Great fun, would rewatch",
BEAUTIFUL Scenery,Shang-chi is amazing. That's all I have to say purr.
11 out of 10,It's fun to see actors from other movies. Grand master and crouching tiger hidden dragon.
So glad this did well,"Where to start, I'll start by saying the choreography is the best in any movie ever made, easily, the cinematography and colouring is also effing fantastic, Simu pulled off a fantastic performance of amazing martial arts, a goofy dude who wasn't annoying, and pulled off emotional scenes very well, CGI was fantastic, the motivations for the plot were as well, I don't think it's perfect because there were some pacing issues, I felt a little bored in the third act for some reason, maybe it was a result of being tired to be honest so that's not they're fault. Great movie.

TINY TINY SPOILER ABOUT POST CREDIT SCENES But I did leave with a bad taste in my mouth because the critics said the post credit scenes were endgame level hype and I was so excited, expected Tobey and/or Andrew, or some x-men, spoiler alert, not even close, wasn't that good. So that is not the movies fault, just lower your credit scene expectations if you're freaking out about it."
"Packed with action, humor, and a beautiful story",
Awesome!!!,"An awesome action adventure fantasy movie with great comedic timing and a compelling storyline and character arc. One of the best marvel origin story's ever. Satisfying climax and one of the best choreography ever. Great CGI, music, and cinematography. A great compelling storyline that leaves you on the edge of your seat. The villain and hero have a great relationship that leaves you with mixed feelings about the good vs hero Dynamic. In the end awesome film."
Good movie,Watched the movie on release date and wasnt sure as I didnt see much advertisement on it. But I can say the movie was amazing. The characters casted worked well for the. But my favourite had to be Trevor!!
Fantastic film. One of the best in the MCU,A must watch for MCU fans and fans of martial arts movies.
"Amazing visuals, keeping it fresh","Just as some amazing marvel movies like Black Panther, Ant-man or Guardians of the Galaxy this movie takes a fresh take on the super hero formula. It may be at it's core the same: hero goes to a journey to learn and defeat the bad guy but it doesn't stop there and pushes it further. Antagonists have their legit reason to be bad and not just for the sake of ""I'm bad because yes"".

Great cast, everyone made good performance. Really liked Tony Leung as the Mandarin, he can show lovely traits as a father figure and also a very scary/powerful one."
The best action marvel movie you will ever see,
Best movie of the year 2021 and I will say this is a must watch movie.,Best movie of the year 2021 and I will say this is a must watch movie. Best one 👍
Review of A legendary Shang chi movie,It's an awesome movie and the best superhero movie of this year till now. I liked it.
Beautiful movie,
Visually stunning,Amazing homage to classic Chinese martial arts films. Truly a joy to watch and visual experience to soak in.
Shang-Chi,"This is one of the best Marvel films. Great visual arts, great story, wonderful family film. Awesome movie."
Better than Expected.,"Wow, this movie was honestly a lot better than I thought it'd be. The action was well done, had good humor, and had a good story with great CGI in it. I was engaged throughout it. The acting was good and believable, especially by the antagonist. I'm impressed and proved wrong, I didn't expect a movie of this level. Not impressed by the soundtrack, but that doesn't take away much from the experience."
"A perfect,blasting and awesome avenger origin movie ever","The fight sequences, the bgm,the vfx omg,the story and the emotion everything was top notch Loved the movie every inch #shang-chi 🔥🔥🔥"
So good!,"I really liked this movie. The story was good, so were the fights and effects. Also, how can you not love Simu Liu? I love him from Kim's Convenience but he blew me away in this. Canada proud! <3."
"It's a Marvel for sure, but there's more.",
One of the most unique superhero movies ever made with fantastical elements and versatile characters!,"Firstly, I went into this with high expectations and the movie did not disappoint at all, I've gotten pretty much everything that I wanted from this film and more.

Secondly, the story is explained with great care and it introduces the audience with amazing, new and fleshed out characters that really elevate this film to another level.

Furthermore, the cast is exceptional and I couldn't have imagined any other cast to represent these characters. This reminded me of how the original Avengers were perfectly cast for their roles. That said, I really have absolutely nothing bad to say about the cast. They played some distinct characters compared to the rest of the MCU with their set of quirks, stories, backgrounds and lives in general.

The only small complaint that I had while watching this movie was that the movie had spent a good portion of its runtime dwelling in the past about certain characters.

All in all, excellent movie with ton of flavor, great cast and amazing characters in a very dynamic story! Would definitely recommend seeing!"
More then expected,"What a wonderful movie. It had great action, beauty, sadness, happiness and funny. The martial arts where awesome and beautiful. The was a wonderful story line. Welcome to The Marvel Universe Shang-Chi, we're looking forward to seeing you again."
Marvel movie,
Shang Chi And The Legend Of Ten Rings,"After a long time, everyone, especially the Marvel Studios' fans has a chance to watch their latest movie in theatres. And to be honest they will be pleased and they SHOULD watch this in theatres. You will get everything you need from a Marvel flick.

Shang Chi And The Legend Of Ten Rings gives a new look at a new hero. It's fresh and it's entertainment at best. To start with positive aspects, the performance as usual are Good. Marvel never misses their castings. Everyone gave their best. Especially the leads Liu and Lueng. Both portrayed themselves perfectly. I was expecting Awkwafina to be a cringe, but she didn't disappointed. Action just brilliant, flawless. The screenplay is elegant. Seeing what new Marvel is showing and what more is about to come will crave fans and everyone for more. Especially the concept of Ten Rings. The mysticism and spiritual material is displayed brilliantly. Fantasy at it's peak. The CGI is just.. flawless as usual. Works tooo damn neat.

The bad aspects of the movie I consider is the Wenvu's (Leung) unsatisfactory agenda. He's clearly a brilliant intimidating villian but with his agenda, he seems nothing but a Delusional guy. The Wong and Abomination arc shown in the trailers fails to deliver any justice. The guy, so they say ""Death Dealer"" was supposed to be a prominent badass, but they wasted his potential. And Marvel can't keep re-using the formula of ""Big Third Act"", ""Good vs. Evil"", with loads of CGI, they have to use and start giving new screenplays for climax. (also the last thing with Katy being sudden Hawkeye in the climax is just.. facepalm. No way they did that!)

Nevertheless, the movie works fine. Along with superb cinematography, good direction and decent background score. Go watch this movie, you'll enjoy and have a good time. Must watch. Not a definite Marvel Masterpiece, but works and balances well with Humor and Outstanding Action.

Shang Chi And The Legend Of Ten Rings: 4/5 Stars."
Fantastically Cultured,"The movie starts with a beautifully narrated and visually stunning story. This is always important to engage the audience from the first moment. This becomes a norm throughout the film.

Marvel films are well known for their pop culture references but this movie does not fall into the trap of putting in references just for the sake of it. There is a perfect balance of comedic relief and heartfelt moments.

The characters are well constructed, especially Shang-Chi, Xialing and the Mandarin. However, I felt that Katy lacked depth.

The movie ended strongly with conflicting feelings about the antagonist. The movie leaves you thinking about it days after it ends.

I would definitely rate this among the best marvel movies of all time, and a very good movie overall!"
9 points for Tony Leung,"The movie should be renamed to ""Wenwu and the Legend of the Ten Rings""."
Fantastic movie,My opinion is very legendary fight and super movie.
Great movie,Fantastic movie. This is a great addition to the Marvel universe. Can't wait to see what's next.
One of the best hero origin story and movie,"It's simply of the best MCU origin story along with ironman, black panther, and Gotg, the character development was great, Cinematography was unique and definitely created a new style of scenery in the MCU, while the fight choreography blew my mind and it is by far the best fight sequence MCU has to offer since Winter soldier, and the CGI was top tier even though it's a martial arts movie it blended in perfectly, and the performances of the actors and actresses was on point, and having a good villain is not really common in the MCU but in this movie you will actually care for the villain and his backstory unlike most of the villains the MCU has produced, hence this is why I think it's one of the most iconic and one of the best hero origin story and movie out there."
Great movie!,It was amazing the fights the ten rings everything just wow.
Snooze,"I nearly fell asleep in the first 15 min of the movie then it picked up a little,after that it was so boring i got up and left half way through the movie."
one of the best solo movies on the MCU,"Visually, one of the most beautiful movies in MCU. More than that, one of the best solo super hero movies in MCU, a grand feat for a debut, even more so without other superheroes like ""crutch"". The performances make justice for the script, showing us that End Game, contrary to what was believed, wasn't the end of Marvel Era. The phase 4 promises be even greater than others. This quality can be easily compared to Black Panter and Captain America and The Winter Soldier level.

Engaging and with the right dose between comedy and battle, the film has impressive fight choreographies.

The credit scenes make connection between the Shang-Chi story to the MCU in a curious way. Can't wait to see what Feige is planning for the future."
Almost a perfect origin movie!,"Mannnn... this movie is good.

Let me... just say.. first of all.. OMG THE FIGHTS! THE ACTION! OH.. MY.. GOD. Marvel did it again after having a slight setback with the just okay black widow movie. This movie has the best fight scenes I've seen since the raid films. The fights are so well choreographed but also fast paced and filmed to perfection. The bus fight is incredible!!!!! The fight in the beginning between the mandarin and the mother.. wow wow wow... OKAY Back to reality. This movie does have flaws. First of all the pacing in like the 3/4rd of the film is a tat slow. The score honestly is weak. Might be my theater but there were moments where the score had to make me feel something and (credits to the movie itself that it let me ) i had to do that all by myself.

The plot sometimes leans to a pretty basic plot, but because of the great screenplay it works.

Cinematography was amazing. The acting was good. And the special effects were very good. One thing that I have to admit. Game of thrones kind of spoiled us with the design of .. a particular mythical creature so... that won't look as great as it could've been but still very good.

But man the fights were incredible.. the camera work was so good. Fluent movements but fast and I could see EVERYTHING. After snake eyes I thought I would never see a good martial arts movie again considering how average that was.

Thank you, shang chi. You made my night.

9 out of 10. Welcome back marvel."
Shang chi is a remarkable 2021 hit,
Disney's failed attempt to kiss china's ass,"Another terrible movie from the mcu which is so childish and embarrassing to watch. The casts are just awful that even look worse than the employees from a grocery store, the acting and reactions are just so stiff, unconvincing, overacted and stupid. The cg is unrealistic with bad compositing that didn't blend well with the scenes, the story is totally cliche and lame, which was so predictable from start to finish. And the best thing above all is their intention to expand the china market by putting in all the chinese elements but got banned by china, well done disney. Do us a favor and stop bloating fake reviews everywhere to overrate the silly movies, this doesnt deserve anything over a 2 stars rating, it sucks."
"Shang-Chi brings on the action, heart and excitement","What a fun ride with some emotionally touching scenes. Tony Leung Chiu-wai worked hard at making his character a different kind of villain who is not stereotypical and the way he loses connection and wallows in grief is deep. You can see what is causing him to act as he does.

Simu Liu carries this movie alongside Tony Leung and it's got a lot of father/son conflict which is touching to see on screen.

The fight scenes are really good, the action is top notch and I liked the friendship running along in the story. Stay for the two end scenes which tease so much!"
A Marvelous Surprise,"Not only does Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings expand the MCU further and introduce new concepts for the future, but it delivers some badass choreographed action scenes and an emotionally complex villain."
Phase 4 starts with a bang,"What a breath of fresh air this film is, it's doesn't feel like your traditional Marvel film till the end scene, mid and end credit scene.

Visually beautiful the creatures and scenery. The action was fast paced and blows you away.

Can't fault this film, you walk out the cinema and could easily walk back in and watch it again."
Super fun and Engaging Movie!!!,"Loved the all-asian cast, but i understand many people aren't going to like that because of their own insecurities, but aside from that the cgi, storyline, and characters all brought an interesting rendition for each of their own and the post credit scene was also a really cool connector into how Shang-Chi may fit in with his new avenger buddies."
Marvel Phase 4 is off to a flyer!,"PHENOMENAL! Absolutely phenomenal! I was worried going into this movie wondering how Shang Chi was going to fit into the MCU. By the 23rd minute... I had a fair idea. By the finale, it was crystal clear. The doors of what is possible in the MCU has been truly kicked off it's hinges!

Guaranteed come Monday morning, kids around the world will be busting their parents chops to get into a Martial Art class. Marvels newest addition to the live action roster will have the same impact as Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan had on many here growing up. It's a certainty.

Action scenes are aplenty and jaw dropping. I have seen way too many Martial Art movies but this for sheer creativity is up there with the best. Score is beautifully written. Story although predictable, does what it needs to do without grinding the movie to a halt. Acting is top notch especially with the lead Simu Liu and Tony Leung Chui-wai.

If I had one bad thing to say about it, it's this... I had to procrastinate either going to the toilet or urinating myself on the seat! Yes it moves that fast. An extremely easy 10/10.

Phase 4 is off to a flyer!"
Must see marvel film! 9.25/10,"This movie was absolutely phenomenal! The acting, the fight choreography, the visuals, the villain, the lore, the story it was all superb! I went into this movie only seeing the first teaser so I didn't really know what to expect. What I got was a beautifully crafted epic journey that made me surprisingly emotional at some parts which was very welcomed for a marvel film. My main worry was awkwafina because I really can't stand her as an actress but man she was GREAT in this. Everyone was pretty great honestly. Also watch this stoned if you can...there are some crazy awesome visuals in this film! Easily the best solo MCU film since Iron Man 1."
10 for Ten,Absolute piece of marvel..though story line is predictable it's well scripted with high visual effects..must watch to experience the power of ten rings.
breathtakingly beautiful,"First I had some concerns just about the fact that Shang Chi is a complete new carachter we never met before and new surroundings. Well this movie is an emotional rollercoaster, worked out beautiful, with just the exact humor, great actors, very detailled fightscenes. And besides the story is very beautiful, it's about getting justice for their lost mom. And this makes it BREATHTAKINGLY BEAUTIFUL."
New phase has a new superhero,"Shang chi is really a fantastic film,reached the expectations very well. Absolutely there is no DOUT,this movie would be one of the Best ACTION film in MCU. This movie has so much of action that we never experienced in MCU quite often. It is purely entertaining for the starting to the end. I would say everyone should watch this movie in theaters and experience the action and the music(bgm) was so awesome😍.

THIS MOVIE 🎥 IS GOING TO BRING NEW ERA OF SUPERHERO."
May be a good movie if you are 10 years old..,Boring and silly CGI. Has Ben Kingsley finally come down to comic roles in kids movies? Sad for him. Wanted to get out and run. Decided not to watch Marvel or any of these super hero stuff in theaters for the next 1-2 years. Will wait for streaming services to show these. .
As an Asian I do not like this,"As an Asian I would not like this film

The choice of character, do they truly represent China or other Asian culture? If a Chinese or other Asian watches this, would they like them just like Americans and Europeans would feel for the character of Iron man or Thor?

The Mandarin talk sounds very strange for people who really speak and understand Chinese.

I can see it is trying to put in some Asian, or at least Chinese bits in, like the water map, the bamboo...... but it is still unable to achieve what we might think is beautiful, but for Westerns, it's fine to show as this is Asian style."
One of the best,"Marvel Origins story are amazing but this one breaks the line. The writing, the humor, the comedy everything is perfect here. The directors made all the best choices which made the movie incredible."
Overrated Asian Epic!!,"This film is only great of its visual, just like any other marvel films. Plot and the actors are boring, even the Marvel miniseries were way better than this crap. All the high ratings are most probably done by asians!! They just want their asian faces to be highly rated. Even the lead actor were pushing Marvel to do an asian superhero, my questions is why only the chinese, korean, japanese are considered as asians? Why cant be the indians, indonesians, mongolian or country like Kuwait and others be main lead as asians?"
Overall Pretty Good,
Save Your MONEY,This movie was bad... it have to be bots behind trying boost this movies review ratings.
LOVED IT!!!!,"Film is great overrall, same story we all know but the way it told is engaging and emotional, first thing i loved in this movie is action sequence, every action scene is so damn good. The soundtrack is amazing. The characters are well written, even a smaller role is kinda memorable, vfx is great but not in high standards in final climax, its not that messy but notable, there are two credits scenes dont miss that. It does what it meant to do(entertainment). Cant wait for further mcu movies."
Total waste of time.,Total waste of time. Iron Man 2008 is so much better. Meh........
Tedious...,"Maybe there are just too many super hero movies now, but I found it boring. Some visual aspects were good and it had an ok story, but just didn't find it as good as hoped for a ""new"" marvel take. The main actor seems more appropriate for a b flick too. He's new so maybe he'll grow."
A new era of marvel has arrived!,I was going in expecting the film to be decent. But it's better than I thought. The film is unbelievably good and exciting!! A lot of culture and amazing martial arts. A must see film!
Brilliant,"Visually outstanding, the choreography of the fight scenes was one of the greatest I ever watched in recent movies. Michelle Yeoh own every single scene that she was on it and Awkwafina was funny as ever. And the story? Great, some plot twists and with great clues to follow the next phase of the MCU!"
Fantastic,"The first real movie of phase 4, and it is absolutely awesome. From the story, through the action, to the world building, never before have I felt that a Marvel movie is an entire deep and elaborated story, as much as this one.

The movie is definitely one of my top 3 movies in the MCU, and if it has any indication of the quality of the rest of the phase, we are up for an incredible phase!"
A new era for Marvel!,"This film contains everything you hope for in a marvel movie. Acting, direction, cinematography, music everything has perfectly blended in this film. Martial arts action sequences with magical mythical creatures and comedic sequences and family sentiments, it is a complete package. It has created a new look to marvel from other movies, and it is one of the best marvel movies. Definitely marvel phase 4 movies are gonna be lit, and this movie has done a great job in introducing it."
Shang-Chi's Beautifully Executed,"Clever story with amazing martial arts and interesting backdrops. I enjoyed and appreciated the English Subtitles that were clear to read and on onscreen longer the most movie subtitles. The martial arts was exhilarating! Loved it! The CGI was colorful and creative. This film should win multiple Oscar Awards!!

This movie was so entertaining I must see it again!!"
OVERRATED!!,"Was fun until Pokemons showed up, should have stuck to martial arts."
"Great Visuals, not more.","The visuals were absolutley amazing, and the fight scenes were pretty cool too.

But then, there's just not much more to talk about.

The acting is average, and the story was simply not interisting. I personally don't hate this movie, (i mean maurice was pretty cute) but if you havent seen i wouldn't recommend watching it. It's not worth the money/time."
A stand out Marvel,"A surpise and great watch from a marvel fan or a typical movie watcher. It really does stand out and tries to be a lot more original than the others, although expect somewhat predicable story plots along the way. It also resolves a previous issue in a marvel film which disappointed many fans, the film deserves credit for that. Great action scenes and tells a very convincing origin story which is well earnt. I'm only rating it a 7 due to the competition of all the rest of the marvel films. But be sure, this one does not disappoint."
New Marvel Movies Feel Too Similar,"Seems like DC will be the king (again), because after No Way Home, they have literally nothing to care about. I used to like both, but right now DC seems to be so much more creative with doing all kinds of different movies. For example compare how extremely different are Joker and Suicide Squad, but both are great in their own way. But in Marvel, every movie feels exactly the same. Same meh effects, generic villains and cringe jokes."
Brilliant!!!!,"Absolutely loved it. Must watch. Non stop action and all you can imagine in a good movie.... I am not saying any more, just watch the film and you will not be disappointed.

I think I will go to the cinema at least one more time to watch it again, that how great it was.

I am simply buzzing!!!"
Shang-chi,I like Marvel try out some new characters into The Marvel universe and overall just a great movie.
MCU is back with a bang!,This movie is action packed with the best action scenes I've seen in the MCU. The story was great and all the cast shined throughout the movie. 10/10 would watch again!
"One of the best ""MARVEL MOVIE"" ever seen.","Best and worth to watch in big screen, Satisfied the expectations,CGI is top notch, and ""NO WORDS"" to discribe the movie."
Bad acting and everything is done by formula.,"This is such a bad movie and the there is maybe two good actors. Its a movie that you can like subjectively because u are asian or something but objectively its terrible. I know asian movies done a long time ago that are better than this. Its really stupid.

The best part about the movie is about the asian bus driver who fullfills the sterotype of how bad asian women are at driving.."
"Empty movie, good cgi",
there only one ring this came out of,
"Booring, really","Its a clasic chineese movie, Jackie Chan reloaded, a Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon part 2, but no a good way, the acting is a really bad, the only fun parts is two scenes when appear a familiar character from Kamar-Taj; if not for marvel, this movie past like a refill movie of end of weekend."
Sucked!,"This movie is both boring and pointless. Do not know how it got such a high score on rotten tomatoes, but it was 2 hours of my lie I will never get back. DO NOT watch tis garbage unless you hate yourself."
featuring the marvel equivalent of jar jar binks,"Easily the worst marvel film along with black widow, awful characters specifically katy, who's as annoying and pointless as jar jar or rose from star wars."
Disappointing. A lot of exposition. Not much sense. And why is there an Awkafina?,This was one of those movies where they tried to recreate better and seemed to think that throwing in every possible cliche and special effect would do it. I have found several films I wanted to enjoy ruined by the performance of Awkafina. She and Timothy Chalamet seem to populate another alternative universe where they are considered star power. But even with her presence I don't think I could like this movie. Nothing new here except an Asian theme.
Best Marvel movie,"The best Marvel movie Ive ever seen! The fight-scenes were so good, i couldn't take my eyes of the screen the whole time. The dad was also very attracitve! I recommend this movie 100%"
Good Start phase 4,I like this movie.. A great asian superhero.. The good movie start phase 4 for MCU... I like it..
Nice One Marvel,"Despite maintaining some of Marvels signature (and sometimes tedious) tropes, Shang Chi shines through as one of my favourite MCU films OF ALL TIME! The action was simply put - Epic. This movie had some truly awesome moments, a fantastic debut for these characters. Shang Chi grabs some of the best parts of Chinese Martial arts cinema and Marvelises them while making it work. Going in to this movie I honestly expected to dislike it given how predictable marvels films have gotten and generally suffering from Marvel bloat but Shang Chi surpassed my expectations and gave me two hours of awesomeness. Side note: The only thing that would've made this movie better is less of the marvel quips and cheese."
Incredible and fresh,Finally a hero from Asia. It's a perfect movie for me so far because the fight scenes and the visualization are beautifully shown. There are also some unpredictable stories that made me amazed. This is the best movie I have ever watched in cinema so far. Waiting for next Shang Chi movie!
Underwhelming,"I went into this movie with a real open mind and I have to say that I was kind of disappointed, for me, the acting felt below par and the story felt very slow moving and didn't really go anywhere. I LOVED the fight scenes though, it was really cool to see pure hand to hand combat and martial arts be the centre of a MCU film. Overall I was not very pleased walking out of the cinema, I didn't feel attached to much of the characters either and there was no pace to the movie."
So great to watch,It's better than expectations. TONY is a really good actor. It consists of many Asian elements which makes the movie more interesting.
Here we go Marvel,
Definitely a solid 8+,"From the first 20 minutes you can tell this was going to be a great movie and well produced.

The fight scene in the bus, graphics and animation were unreal. And for the actor, felt like I was watching a new age Jackie Chan.

The movie had a lot of comedy, action And story line was a little played out but still amazing.

Best part is going to a movie that you hardly heard about and you're not really expecting much from the movie and it ends up being great ..

Not really a spoiler but stay past the credits haha."
Best movie with The Top Notch VFX. LOVED THE MOVIE,Best CGI. And must watch Movie. With Top Notch VFX. Loved the Movie So Much.
Jackie Chan's way of filming fights,"During watching movie i had this flavor of Jackie, after the film i found out that Brad Allan from Jackie team helped with fight scene...want to rewatch it again."
Great start for the new heros,"The film really went well from beginning to the end. It was really great with the visuals. The bus action sequence was great and visually was a treat to watch. Simu liu did great as shang-chi.

Climax is something which you should be most awaited for. Cheers for the whole the team of shang-chi."
Loved it!,Loved it from the beginning til the end. This movie deserves all the hype and I was not disappointed.
More than a marvel movie,"How do I start, this movie first is full of excitement, i just seen it and i was blown away, the visuals was stunning and the fight scenes?? Well i will say it was more than i expected in a very good way, i mean they were throwing down in this movie, it feel like a marvel movie not saying marvel is a bad franchise movie wise but...it has its own feel to it i do feel there is more to this movie, i will say i dont think the ten rings are the ten rings but something else, there are a lot of easter eggs in this movie from the hulk to iron man but they don't spend a lot of time going back in the past about heros, just small nods to some of the heros and certain movies, all in all this movie has strenth unlike black widow which had me falling asleep from time to time, a must go see, get the family and go see it in dolby digital at the theaters or imax, the beginning moves slow but it picks up and you're drawn in, I'm going back sunday to see it again, and i might go back the following sunday to see it as well, the movie is just that good...enjoy the watch of this movie, if you do not go...wel thats your lost."
Epic!,"This was so epic on so many levels, far surpassed any expectations. The story was fantastic, visually stunning, and the fight sequences were phenomenal! My favorite Marvel movie in a LONG time. Outstanding, so excited for the rest of Phase 4."
Amazing,"Story amazing, fight scenes amazing, scenery amazing, everything amazing."
Amazing movie - way better than expectation,"The movie was such a beautiful motion picture and had such amazing things to share in regards to culture. The lines outside the theatre were long and they were all different lines for different Shang Chi movie times. At first I was like wow is it really that good? But after finishing I found it to be super touching, heart wrenching at times, but still meaningful, and a marvel cinematic masterpiece. I encourage people to watch it! 1000/10 if possible!"
Spectacular,Felt so fresh. This is exactly the type of movie the MCU needed to keep the hype train chugging.
Awesome,Best marvel movie since Thor Ragnarok. Great new addition to the MCU I love this movie and it just makes me seem so fresh and revived. The action scenes were so good the best since winter soldier and I just fell in love with this movie.
ONE OF THE BEST MCU FILMS BY FAR,"ONE OF THE BEST MCU ORGINS STORIES EVER TOLD, this was SUCH A SLEEPER FILM.!"
Great Movie,Depicts Asian American life perfectly. Can confirm as a SF asian American native. Katy's pretty damn accurate.
Worth the hype and REALLY FRESH in the MCU,"I was truly hyped for this movie just by seeing the bus clip and the trailer. I'm a huge marvel fan (not a comic reader), so I didn't know anything about Shang Chi, only heard about him. After seeing this movie, I was truly amazed. It was funny, the action sequences were very amazing, the fight choreography was awesome, reminded me of Jackie Chan. CGI was amazing.

I gotta say, after seeing the movie, Shang Chi is in my top 3 favorite Marvel Charachters, and the best MCU movie for me.

ITS WORTH WATCHING. Don't listen to the negative reviews. Go see it."
So insanely good,"Plot, action, comedy, emotion, character, relationships, theme, development, cinematography, all 10/10. Go watch!!"
Worth the Watch,
"Lush, beautiful film that could have used a bit less dignity","Watched Shang-Chi and the Ten Rings - despite the movie title sounding like one of those 1940s black and white ""Detective Dee and the...."" types, the film is visually stunning: stunning scenery, magical creatures, gorgeous costumes, no-holds-barred fight scenes that are as much dancing as fighting, you name it.

I do have issues, however. The first is that I think Marvel was so worried about offending China or the Chinese people that the film comes across as very safe. Far too much on its dignity. If the film were a job interview, it would have been for the position of senior Vice President at the Chinese equivalent of the Louvre. Even Akwafina, who I usually count on to deliver a raunchy belly-laugh of a good time, was very composed and restrained.

I'm also wondering why they bothered including Shang-Chi's sister. She doesn't really *do* anything except be moody and resentful for the majority of the film. Even in the after-scene, she's not there. As far as I can tell, the entire point of her inclusion in the film is to get Shang-Chi to Macau (bonus points for it not being the overused Hong Kong or Singapore!).

Dignity or not, there was plenty of opportunity where they could have upped the humour quotient. The Chinese people are dignified - famous for it - but they also have a ribald and sophisticated sense of humour. I would have *loved* to see sly digs at Western culture, more commentary on differences between East and West (you can't tell me a guy spends his life in an isolated Chinese compound or in the States then just seamlessly segues to Macau's urban lifestyle!), that kind of thing - more than the stereotypical ""When are you getting married? When are you going to get a real job?"" conversation. Basically, they could have really *done* something with this movie, over and above a superhero story.

One thing I *really* want to see is a guide to the creatures we see in the film. They are so beautifully rendered! The Fu Dogs, for example - I was mesmerized watching the tiny little movements - ear flicks, muscle twitches as if reacting to a bug bite, the movement of the fur and mane: magnificent! But there were so many others I have no clue what they were other than they looked like Chinese mythological creatures and I would love to know more about them."
Meh.,
"Not bad how Iron Man 3 and Thor 2, but not very good.","Shang chi is not the classic Marvel movie and I appreciate that. The direction in two situations is brilliant otherwise nothing special. The plot does not tell me much and the motivation of the villain (the Mandarin) I find very stupid. We see that Marvel is focusing a lot on Shang chi, especially for the scene after the credits. The characters are not very characterized, except in the relief comic. Overall I find it a forgettable film, apart from two action scenes."
Fantastic,"This film is everything I wanted to be, and it's actually even better than I expected. The action sequences are awesomely bad-A, the jokes and comedic scenes are hilarious and never unfunny, the cgi is great, the emotional scenes hit hard, and the cinematography is gorgeous. And it's also something fresh and unique, and it doesn't feel like a Marvel movie (if that makes sense) which I like, and it also brings something new to the MCU. Overall, this film is fantastic, and sometimes even emotional, and I recommend you go watch this at the cinema for the full experience. 10/10."
"A G-Rated Disney action movie, too childish for the Marvel universe",
First movie in years that got me tearing up and getting goose bumps,"I watched a few Marvel movies for the humor and action, and they were never ""great"" movies to me, so I was expecting to like it but nothing else.

In the first few minutes the narrator only speaks Chinese with subtitles, which is a change from the usual immediate switch to English. At the first fighting scene I noticed how cool the music was, It's a bit like dubstep? But it really works with the scenery. Morgan Freeman's small role made me laugh, I didn't expect him there.

I was also not expecting to see some things that were slightly mentioned during the movie, I really thought they were gonna keep it mysterious even though it's Marvel.

I'm glad the comic relief characters weren't all there all the time, weren't the only ones being funny, and more importantly played a big role in the story. That was very pleasant.

Of course the acting was great too, and the sad scenes were believable. I rarely see a main character tearing up. I wish they could cry like a normal human would. A lot of movies suffer from the badass-blank-face protagonist, this wasn't totally the case here.

Big pro is the lack of forced romance, kissing and whatever. I hate that stuff. The girl always falls in love with the guy but not here (or it's not shown). Though the parents shouldn't have fallen in love either by my standards The only bit of blood in the movie was really fake looking, but the other 3D animated made up for it

One thing I'm not happy about is how confusing some action scenes are. No idea what's going on, or where the protagonist is going. It slows down for the important hits, but those are typical Marvel action scenes.

I also didn't like that the sister was overshadowed and that she forgave so easily.

This is closer to a 10 than a 9 so I gave 10. I'm just so happy I felt something while watching a movie. It's been so long!"
A very good action flick before it was overtaken by CGI.,"The action is the movie's biggest selling point. The hand to hand combat is done exceptionally well and the use of the environment and camera movement added to the flow and intensity of each scene.

Character development and interactions is also fine. The only criticism I have is how the final fight got a bit too CGI-heavy. It really didn't need the super fantastical elements and definitely took away the character development the story was building up to. It kind of just felt like the higher-ups said a Marvel movie needs something grandiose despite the rest of the film was kept grounded.

Other than this, and the fact that a side character was able to pull a MVP hit out of thin air, the movie is very enjoyable. There is some truly breathtaking scenes and there's plenty of memorable martial arts scenes to go around. Growing up with these kung fu movies, I think you'll enjoy it as much as I did."
a gorgeous movie,"Shang-Chi has instantly entered my top 5 of Marvel movies. There is so much to adore about this movie. The visuals are beautiful, the villain is compelling, the last sequence isn't very predictable, as superhero movies can often be. The characters all have a level of depth that is often missing from the supporting characters in superhero movies, and I was pleased that they didn't marginalize Xialing as it would've been easy to do. I don't know much about the different disciplines of martial arts, but it seems very similar to Avatar: The Last Airbender in how they drew inspiration from different real world fighting styles for different fighters in the movie. If I compare the acting to the other movies I consider the best to produced by Marvel (Infinity War, Ragnarok, Winter Soldier, etc.), Shang-Chi is a notch below, but it blows every other Marvel movie out of the water when it comes to action and choreography. The bus scene in the first act has easily become my favorite sequence in any Marvel film. Origin films often fall into the same traps, but Shang-Chi doesn't, maybe because many didn't know much about the character. But even so, typical tropes like training sequences were done better in Shang-Chi, and the story didn't linger on his youth too much."
shang chi unlimited screening review,I've just got out the unlimited screening 10 out of 10 best marvel action origin film of MCU if u love action fantasy film this is Ur film.
Loved it,
Best Marvel movie yet,"So good! I loved it. Exciting, funny, visually stunning, likeable characters, amazing action sequences, I recommend it!!"
Pleasantly surprised!,"Didn't have high hope before going in because neither Simu nor Awkwafina was a superhero movie casting material, and Mandarin is a very controversial villain of choice, but I was pleasantly surprised on how good Shang-Chi was.

The chemistry between Simu and Awkwafina was exceptional, and Tony Leung's casting of Not-Mandarin aka Xu Wenwu was not just amazing, but one of the best villains Marvel has ever seen. It's a villain whose motivation is actually both believable and relatable. Oh, and the actual ""Mandarin"" was also a comical gold.

Plus, fighting scenes were absolutely amazing. First half's martial art scenes were on par with some martial arts classics and later half of, well, typical Marvel CGI stuff were quite of eye candies.

Sure, there were few less developed character arcs like Shang-Chi's sister but overall, this is an excellent movie that won't disappoint you."
!,It's great...! Really... this review is too short.
Lame,"Boring, nothing special,predictable nonsense, all flash, no substance. Fight scenes are laughable. Aquavelva needs to retire,horrible actress. Marvel should have stopped with endgame."
Marvel is trembling the theaters again!!!,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is the 2nd mcu movie returning to the cinemas all over the world and WHAT A WAY TO GET BACK IN THE GAME. As many marvel/mcu films has the good and the bad.

The good: The most remarkable factor was the coreography from the action/fight sequences, very fluid and not exagerated.

The soundtrack was another amazing factor, we are talking of a mixture of cultures (i really felt Black Panther vibes on this one) that can engage all the marvel and non marvel fans out there.

Regards of the plot, this one was very emotional and with lot of heart and power.

The cgi effects was on point (which was my biggest fear and sometimes a let down on other mcu films)

The bad: Shang chi, along side of the cast lacks of good and reliable acting which with combining with the signature forced jokes was little annoying to see.

Althought the plot was simple, this was a little predictable, but overall enjoyable.

Final thoughts: Despite of the forced acting, A must watch movie that definitely will engage the audience with all its assets."
Seriously Poor,"I have just arrived home from the cinema. Whilst I have seen the majority of the MCU movies many times, I hope I never see this one again. It's beyond me how some people can give this high ratings. There were some good actions scenes which generated the 2 stars but that's as far as it goes. I like Ben Kingsley, but what was his character doing in the movie? - it was completely out of place and had a ridiculous story line as to why he was there. However it did add the funniest part to the movie where he thought the apes in the original Planet of the Apes films were actually apes. My wife, who is a big MCU fan, also thought it was poor. My 11 year old son thought it was OK because he was proud of himself for recognising Wong & Abomination. I am going to cheer myself up now by watching ' The Face of Fu Manchu' - that's go a proper villain in it."
Great Visually - Maybe I Missed Something,
THE BEST SOLO SUPERHERO MOVIE OF 2021,"What an Amazing Movie...... REALLY A VISUAL TREAT FOR THE AUDIENCE.

Shang-chi deserves The Best Solo Hero Movie Of 2021.

Visual effects are the best Super powers of Shang chi are really good.

Dont miss the 2 Post credit scenes MARVEL FOREVER."
"Marvel, youve done it again😍","This is the best marvel film i have seen besides Endgame, it bring a whole new feeling to the MCU and it pays off tenfold. Not much else to say."
Great,Didn't know about the movie and was skeptical but ill tell you u won't regret it. Best movie out of covid times.
Best CGI STORY IN MCU TO DATE AND TO THOSE BAD REVIEWS HAVE NO TASTE AND DIDNT WATCH,The CGi and story telling was out of this world. Character development too! The ones who gave it a bad rating clearly has 0 taste and probably did not watch the movie. This movie made people into shang chi fans! Marvel stepped up! And I am happy!!!!
The best Marvel film since Endgame,"Amazing visuals, phenomenal fight choreography and a genuinely interesting story. I never knew about the character before but Shang Chi has already become a favourite of mine. I really hope he shows up in Dr Strange: Multiverse of Madness."
THE movie of the Decade thus far!,Visually stunning. Awesome fight scenes. Many Easter Eggs.
nothing out of this world but a lot better then i expected,
this movie sucks,"This movie was very disappointing. It was very poorly made and did not seem to be thought out at all. Which is why I was bewildered to find that this movie was so widely liked by the mcu fanbase, and was saddened to find even some of my friends liked the movie. I've seen this film be praised for its good characters, humor, fight scenes and storytelling. But I strongly disagree with almost all praise for this movie. I will admit there are some things to praise this movie for but whatever they are they are few and far between.

This movie had some decent choreography for the fights, about a third of the fights were pleasing to the eye. However I only enjoyed 2 fights and that is only because the lead actor Simu Liu was the main focus of the fights. With Simu Liu background in martial arts he was able to do the fight choreography without the movie resorting to the overly zoomy and shaky camera with 5 cuts per movement that plagues most of the other mc movies. But sadly the rest of the fights are the typical marvel cutty fights or a gross mush of group fights with no discernible stakes.

The main character actually had some good moments where I felt like he was a good person and he actually did not cause casualties in the double digits unlike most of the other recent ""heroes"". But he has no personality and all of his decisions make little sense. The bad guy has many of the same problems where they establish his character but then they make him do things against that character. Sadly there were no other characters that could carry them due to the fact that most of the characters in the movie were either soulless things with useless unfunny jokes or characters with exposition to shove down our throats, and only made decisions to move the plot onwards. This saddened me greatly because I rather like a lot of the actors in this movie.

There were 2-3 jokes in the whole movie that I found even remotely funny. Besides those all the jokes were bad and lazy, usually ruining the mood of the scene or just carrying on for far too long. But due to the large amount of jokes and the little amount of comedic relief all of the ""funny"" characters seemed tasteless, unfunny and annoying.

The story told was not inherently bad, It just had to rely on the hollow dialog to carry it along. And with most of the characters not really being expanded upon they seem to only be vesicles for this bad move to work.in all i did not enjoy watching this movie, i did however enjoy bashing on it with my friends and making fun of my ex-friends for liking it."
Don't know why it's rating is too high,Today I watched and find nothing special Nothing new and extraordinary.
Amazing,"I decided to go in blind to this movie and I loved every thing about this movie it's humour, acting and it's characters but most of all the fight scenes GO AND WATCH THIS MOVIE."
Surprisingly good time,"I'm super happy to say that Marvels newest movie outing, ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"", is a hilarious, action packed, CGI thrill ride and it's a fantastic one at that. After seeing ""Black Widow"" I was worried that Marvel/Disney had started shifting their focus to their very ambitious TV mini series projects and left the quality of their movies behind. I'm now confident that isn't the case. Here, sets, visuals, costumes, choreography, score, acting and directing are all top notch. Each shot feels fresh and visually stunning. Each joke and emotion land. And the action is amazing. The first big set piece involving Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) and his best friend (awkwafina), is a bus ride to work gone horribly wrong, it hooks you instantly and has you either in awe with its incredible fight choreography or laughing at the perfectly timed jokes. It really doesn't let up in either category going forward. I can't believe how much I loved the pairing of these characters, their choice to not make it romantic and I love how different and real they feel from other characters in the MCU. Often Marvels problem has been their reliance on the same personality traits for their heroes, funny jerks with over confidence or bumbling idiots thrust into power. Here the main character is naturally a good person, hes comfortable with being himself and with his best friend, when power comes to him he accepts, he never truly stops being him, he doesn't have to learn a lesson, he just rolls with the punches. Almost all of this goes to actor Simu Liu who brings an extra dose of likability to the role, along with the chemistry he shares with Awkwafina which makes their friendship believable. There's even great references, cameos and credit scenes for the fans looking for that. Of course there are problems, the biggest is the big CGI slug fest ending that plagues these types of films, when all it truly needed to do was be smaller. It's a mess of CGI at times and feels a little too big and too rushed. Characters just instantly know and understand things and accept everything with ease. It is easy to over look all this, with how much fun you'll have."
Bringing up MCU to new world,"POSITIVE -great Casting (SImu Liu, Tony Lueng). Especially Tony Lueng because he look badass and has great acting skill.

-You've already heard people praising the film's action choreography, and it's well-deserved. It doesn't has many cut scenes like many MCU fighting scenes.

-This film felt completely unique from what we've seen from the MCU already.

-Props to the beautiful cinematography and soundtrack as well, they were great!

-The first two act was incredible and amazing showing the life of Shang-Chi, how Wenwu meet his wife etc. This type of act is something MCU usually doesn't have.

-This film open up MCU to new world with myth creature, many evil organization, and the mystery of the Ten Rings.

NEGATIVE -The casting was STELLAR. Aside from the one person I didn't care for (*Razor Fist, cough cough*) everybody played their roles to perfection.

-The jokes may not be funny to some people. But It's funny to me.

-The only issue I had with Shang-Chi was the third act. Not that it was bad, but it felt detracting from what the first 2/3rds of the movie established. It become every MCU logic part(CGI BATTLE). It took away from the great hand-to-hand action stunt work, but it's to be expected from a film of this genre.

character into this universe.

IMO Great way to introduce new hero. Great Martial art fight scenes. Great characters. Looking forward to Shang-Chi. Also Wenwu.

Not a Top Tier Film in Movie Industry but A Top Tier Film in MCU STANDALONE movies."
The best Marvel movie so far...,"Having seen the trailer for the 2021 Marvel action movie ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" I must admit that of course I was going to watch it, but I feared it would just be another run-of-the-mill-over-the-top-CGI-fest-but-barred-of-proper-contents Marvel movie. Yet, I opted to sit down and watch it, on the notion that it was a Marvel movie. But also because of the cast that starred in it.

And yeah, this movie was over the top in terms of CGI. Of course it was, because it is a Marvel movie after all. But luckily this movie broke the formula of the archetypical Marvel movie and this actually turned out to be the best Marvel movie so far. Well, at least in my opinion. Why? Well, because of the storyline and the fact that it mixed Asian culture and lore into the Marvel cinematic universe, and it was a much needed addition to an otherwise Western-focused series of movies.

The storyline told in ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"", as written by Dave Callaham, Destin Daniel Cretton and Andrew Lanham was certainly entertaining. And the movie didn't really have a dull moment, despite the fact that it was a movie that ran for 132 minutes. I thoroughly enjoyed the entire movie from beginning to end. And for me, this was a storyline with proper contents to it, that also included interesting characters and creatures.

Visually then ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" blew me away. The CGI team really worked their magic with this movie and brought it to life in a very visually fulfilling way. Lots of nice details and jaw-dropping special effects. And the creature designs in the movie were off the charts, I really enjoyed seeing those brought to life on the screen.

The character gallery in ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" was interesting, and that applies for both the villain and good guy side.

And they had such a great cast ensemble put together for ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"", with the likes of Asian cinema heavy weighters such as Tony Chiu-Wai Leung, Michelle Yeoh and Wah Yuen. But the movie was also nicely carried by Simu Liu, whom I was not familiar with prior to this movie. And also having Awkwafina in the movie was just brilliant, because she put on a spot on performance with her comedy sidekick character. And it was interesting and nice to see Ben Kingsley return to reprise his character of Trevor Slattery.

""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" is a good combination of action and narrative storytelling, which made for a very wholesome movie. And it should be said that the action sequences were breathtaking to behold, so very, very nicely choreographed and executed on the screen, taking that traditional Wuxia elements seen in Asian movies and mixing it in with the archetypical Marvel Western-based superhero movies.

I was more than genuinely entertained by ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" and it is certainly a movie that bolsters Marvel's hold for me, as their movies tend to be super flashy with spectacular effects, but rather hollow in terms of proper entertainment and storytelling.

My rating of ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" lands on a well-deserved nine out of ten stars. Director Destin Denial Cretton ensured that this 2021 movie takes the role of the single best Marvel movie to date for me."
slap in the face for women,"I have to say it, Hollywood is pretty honest in this movie and tells it as it is: As a woman, you can be badass and tough and strong - but you will always play the second fiddle. It's outraging. Although the plot was a mess and this movie was all over the place - this was the true message that came across. The mother and the sister were the strongest characters, yet the mother had to give up her powers when she married this horrible man and the daughter - despite being overlooked all her life mustered up the strength and motivation to become a great fighter. Although she was way stronger than her brother, she ended up with nothing, while her brother is now the master of the rings. A real slap in the face of every woman and every girl who is going to watch this movie. Oh, and have I mentioned the awful plot?"
Worst marvel movie ever I saw.,This marvel movie was the most disappointed movie I ever seen.
Crouching Tiger meets Marvel,"Below average martial art flick and falls short as a super hero film. Most of the movie isn't in English. First act was promising, 2nd act boring, last act saved the movie from an absolute fail. Character development was weak. No build up for the fight scenes, not enough conflict, dull storyline/protagonist/plot.

Can't really say much good about this film. Seemed to miss every mark. Had a few promising moments, not enough build up to any meaningful conflict, hard to stay invested when half the movie isn't in English. The fight scenes weren't great. Didn't quite feel like a marvel film and yet didn't quite deliver as a martial arts film. Everything that makes a superhero film or martial art film good was just missing here. Lots of ways this could have went better. Seemed rushed, bad writing and under budget perhaps."
Marvel with a twist,
house of mouse and marvel,"This is the story of ten rings, weapons, used for thousands of years to take power and control. Shang chi ( simu liu, as chang xi ) accidentally gets pulled into the history, and can't turn back. Co-stars awkwafina, tony leung, both winners of TONS of film festival awards. Also ben kingsley... oscar for gandhi. Although he looks so different, you may not recognize kingsley in his role! It's a marvel story, from disney, so there's a good mix of adventure, violence, animation, levitation, and some jokes sprinkled here and there. The bad guys are collecting the pendants with the power, and cannot be allowed to gether them all. Surprisingly, a couple swears, giving it the PG13 rating. They meet good people that want to help them on their journey, and evil people that want to destroy them. Some fun special effects. Directed by destin cretton. Chang xi character created by steve englehart, jim starlin. It's quite good."
"Kungfu, music & visuals won me.","Yes. Put kungfu, dj & instrumental music and awsome graphics in a blender, I'm gonna chug it down even if it turns out to be broccoli or walnut smoothee ( or kashayam in my native language). The story is plain, but these things didn't make it noticeable. A grand welcome to the new avengers (hopefully) inductee."
Really Liked It!,"The acting was good. The story was easy to follow. The visuals were amazing! The fight scenes were really fun to watch. Highly recommend.

This is a great action movie to add to your collection. I hope to see Simu Liu in more movies.

Awkwafina was great, as usual. Love her!"
HIDDEN DRAGON MEETS THE MARVEL UNIVERSE,"I must say this is definitely one of the better Marvel instalments ,its a fantastic thrill ride from start to finish were the ancient world of Chinese martial arts intertwines with the ever developing Marvel universe , Jackie Chan like martial arts brings comedy to the fight scenes and we mite be looking at the new HIDDEN DRAGON here in Simu Liu who mite possess the potential to fill a martial arts void left behind by the masters Lee , Chan , Li & Yen. The ten rings are powerful and yet their power lies within the wielder so the balance between good and evil will depend on who wears them , hidden worlds , mythical dragons , magic & sorcery will it be enough to repel an ancient evil buried in time or will the 10 rings be possessed by a new spirit hidden in the heritage of ancient people, brilliantly executed adventure and gives hope to the Marvel universe so I say more of the same for future projects because I was getting worried,"
What a beautiful movie!,"Absolutely beautiful photography, history, effects!

The coreography even made me want to start practicing some Kung fu.

I'd have given it a 10, but the marvel part in the end ruined it by how dumb it was :("
Not a good SUPERHERO movie!,
Marvel with a touch of Jackie Chan and some wire fu,"I'm pretty well aware that I'm late to the party because I wasn't interested at first, but the more I think about its high ratings and scores, the stronger my urge to think like ""Well, there's no harm watching it once, is there?"". Well, to honest, it's pretty decent. MCU with a touch of Jackie Chan's ""Police Story"" series with some elements of wire fu that you can find in 2000's ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" and 2002's ""Hero"", because, you know, all of those ancient China settings. It's pretty intense at first, gets a little boring in the middle, then becomes action-packed again by the third act, though it's going a little bit too rushed. The CGI is pretty standard, MCU standard, which means good, not great, not terrible. Love Simu, he really looks like he's having fun with the role he's given; Awkwafina's character isn't as annoying as I had thought it would be; and as usual, like I've been saying about the MCU: some of the jokes are cringey or don't land very good at best, but it's just me tho, I don't know about you guys, maybe you'll find it funny you'd laugh your ass off, or just smile a little, who knows? Find it yourself...

8.5/10."
Predictable yet eye candy,
An Instant Classic,"Typically, there's a line to be drawn between mixing genres, and to a certain degree Shang-Chi and the Legend could easily be categorized as being just another knock-off of the Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon type Chinese legend tale.

But thankfully, MARVEL were (more than ) able to avoid that mistake. They achieved this by making sure to meld only the best aspects of Chinese martial arts culture with the best aspects of Marvel Universe, superhero tenets.

I won't include spoilers, suffice to say, this turned out to be an epic display of action, fantasy, thriller and just enough lighter humor to not come across as try hard, cheesy.

In all, if you're a fan of both Chinese martial arts, fantasy-legend and Marvel Universe, you will almost definitely enjoy, what i can easily see (imho) as becoming a classic."
One of the best,"In a world where the MCU movies are getting more and more predictable, I thought this was a great way to mix it up! This was an amazing way to introduce one of the lesser known characters within the marvel universe :)"
Almost Perfect,"For Me that was the Marvel Movie of the year, It is so good in every point, Visual effects, Martial Arts Fight Scenes that i loved, Cast, The landscapes, Story and Direction, Soundtrack and so on.

I was not expecting that good but, When i watch it, I was impressed

I recommend the movie for everyone."
Best action,Best action sequences of MCEU Love the movie characters and all the stuff happening Best action movie of marvel universe without doubt It's crazy af Great great great movie.
Better than expected!,"I was pleasantly surprised by the twist and turns in the plot. Great acting and a great script! A very good movie! A very well balanced storyline and spectacular special effects, and great martial arts scenes. I also liked the comedy."
Underrated as hell!!,
Omg,
Wouldn't be missed!,
Oriental martial arts entered Marvel,"The introduction of new superheroes into the cinematic universe has always been accompanied by reactions from the audience. People who are not familiar with comics take a long time to adapt to new characters on the screen. There was a time when not everyone knew even Thor. The Guardians of the Galaxy have been cleverly introduced with humor to further develop their inherent style of comedy and adventure. But what about Asian rental? After all, the profit of the Middle Kingdom brings a lot, so the director Destin Daniel Cretton raised the comics from the dusty shelf.

Before us seems to be a typical Marvel movie, but after the large-scale ""The Avengers"" it is perceived dryly and narrowly. Easter eggs, of course, are shooting from everywhere. Yes, a few cameos will pleasantly delight fans, but if the tape had been separately about Shang-Chi and the legend, and not with a postscript to the MCU, it would have turned out much better. To seed the plot, the opening story of the ten rings serves as an explanation of the artifact and a representation of the antagonist.

The amusement ride introduces us to Shang-Chi and his girlfriend Katie. While the introduction of the characters is accompanied by routine episodes, leading to a showdown in the kung fu style in order to somehow entice, there is no excitement inherent in KVM films. The story of the return to his homeland, the fight against the ghosts of the past and the clouding of the mind of the main villain give the journey and disclosure of the hero. Constant flashbacks somehow clarify the situation, hence the uncomfortable perception.

It was unexpected to meet Emil Blonsky - aka Abomination. Thirteen years have passed since The Incredible Hulk, and now we meet again. Such vivid and colorful underground battles between the heroes complement this story with a general view of the universe after Thanos' snap. To add Shang-Chi to the magic branch of the CME, Wong meets us with his portal rings. The fight against the past and the disclosure of an ancient legend is accompanied by drama, regular flashbacks and a funny play on Mandarin and the events of the third ""Iron Man"". Actually, Trevor Slattery visited the plot of this MCU series.

The picture tries to ascribe all the events already known, either playfully playing on previous films, then approaching the new artifact with all seriousness. The key location, which both reveals the prophecy and explains the legend of ancient evil, sends us to Narnia. Seriously, a magical land with fantastic creatures (Newt Scamander has already left) refers to all family, adventure films about the struggle between good and evil. In addition to the Chronicle of Narnia, we have here ""Bridge to Terabithia"", ""Spiderwick: The Chronicles"", ""Inkheart"", ""Jumanji"", but not like the Marvel Cinematic Universe. An epic fight at the end - as it should be, demonstrating the power of the rings and setting yourself on the path of a warrior.

Entertainment, which is set to show action, a magical world, battles and acceptance of your past. No sense of connection with previous films. Despite the references and cameos, the film should be taken as an individual project. The post-credits scene already reveals familiar faces and attributes ten rings to common magical artifacts in Kamar Taj.

Actor Simu Liu looked simple and new. If, for example, the first performance of Doctor Strange was accompanied by the already familiar Benedict Cumberbatch, then Shang-Chi does not boast of this. The target audience has already thinned noticeably. In addition, the eternal problem of the MCU is raised - no one knew about the threat, except for the heroes of the new picture. Okay Nick Fury (or Skrulls), but the Ancient One, Doctor Strange? Such a massive threat, which actually had to somehow react to Thanos' click. In general, we are again stepping on the same rake, ignoring our own rules."
Less pretentious than most of the Marvel movies,"I really enjoyed this one. The story line was quite straight forward, but the movie was less pretentious and had a lot of grace at some point (nods to Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon). The colour scheme and action scenes were absolutely amazing. Great cast, with a funny Awkwafina (but please, don't start playing the same type-character roles now). I would say, this is one of my most favourite Marvel movies."
Good,"I didn't expect a really good movie but this is really good really enjoyed myself even comedy is in it.

If you are a marvel fan then you really have to watch this."
Good action is not enough: Shang-Chi and the Marvel-problem!,"With ""Endgame"", the MCU had its well-deserved success in 2019. But how should it continue after that? It was clear that Kevin Feige did not want to quit, of course. But unfortunately I have to say that no film or show after the ""Avengers"" spectacle has really convinced me so far. That's why I was hoping for ""Shang-Chi"" (2021), which should score points above all with spectacular action scenes (inspired by Asian cinema). But after watching the movie, I'm unfortunately anything but enthusiastic. ""Shang-Chi"" has great action here and there, but what about the rest?

Shaun and his best friend Katy are searching for a meaning in their life when suddenly Shaun's father, a powerful mafia boss with magical rings in his possession, visits his son. The reason is that Shaun was trained to be a killer, but wanted a different life. Sadly his father cannot accept that ...

I'll have to spoil small details, but in my opinion ""Shang-Chi"" is not a film that can really be spoiled because it is made like almost every other typical superhero film.

First, let's get to the action, which has received so much critical acclaim. Yes, the choreographies are really impressive and beautiful to look at in the first two thirds. This is something that a lot of MCU movies don't do well, which is why I really appreciate the action here too. BUT when the finale is approaching, the action quickly subsides. Because here it unfortunately needed a big CGI battle festival with big creatures and apocalyptic events. This is exactly what was already dealt with critically in ""Civil War"", but Marvel keeps falling into this old superhero-cliché. For the ""Avengers""-films, that decision is perfectly fine (especially for ""Infinity War"" and ""Endgame""), but what about the stand alone films? Here you have to keep asking yourself: Where are the other Avengers? Where is Spider-Man, Doctor Strange or Captain Marvel?

""Shang-Chi"" would have worked so much better if the finale had been a personal battle between Shaun and his dad. Instead, you need gigantic demons and CGI battles. Even the green screen work is not always good in my opinion and quickly looks artificial and fake. No matter what you think about the ""Matrix"" sequels, but the fight scenes there are so much more impressive to me because you often only used CGI when you needed it. Or let's watch Asian martial arts films with Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan. There was hardly ever any computer trickery because most of these films were shot between the 60s and 80s. At the moment you can rather watch the ""John Wick""-films if you want to see spectacular and hand-made action. Because ""Shang-Chi"" unfortunately has little to offer apart from the action ...

The story is the absolute run-of-the-mill cliché stuff, which is now rather parodied in many of these films. The classic outsider who has problems with his father and still has to learn a lot about himself, but is already so good that he could do it on his own easily. His girlfriend Katy is the necessary sidekick and knocks out the obvious jokes so that the viewer does not get too lost in the drama. Everything is so forced and unnatural that I was bored to death. And Marvel films in particular are supposed to be fun and entertaining. ""Shang-Chi"" wants to repeat the ""Black Panther"" success and shows a superhero who is not white, but in this case of Asian origin. And that's great and important, but in the end we mustn't forget that a film cannot be judged solely on the basis of its intentions. Even ""Black Panther"" was only average for many fans in the end, but it could offer a bit more interesting story elements for me.

The MCU is currently suffering from a trivial ""mass taste"" identity. Everything that came after ""Endgame"" can be described in one word: Safe. ""Shang-Chi"" is also designed in such a way that as many people as possible can enjoy the film. It wants to be dark and ""cool"", but at the same time also child-friendly and funny.

Another problem are the way too perfect protagonists of these new MCU works. They can often solve all of their problems within one film. At the end of the movie, for example, Shang-Chi has practically nothing that he can improve on. Tony Stark or Peter Parker had to fight and work on themselves in every film and often did not reach their goal by the end of the film. But that makes characters more exciting in many ways. In my opinion, the characters in ""Shang-Chi"" are too superficial with their problems. It may all be heartbreaking and violent on paper, but the execution doesn't seem anything but real. It's a typical movie that feels like a typical movie and sounds like a typical movie.

The actors may not be the reason for all of this, but I didn't find any of the acting performances really convincing or interesting. Yes, lead actor Simu Liu is physically capable of doing these great stunts himself and I really appreciate that. But there has to be more when it comes to acting as well. And that applies to everyone in the cast, except maybe Tony Leung Chiu Wai, who plays Shaun's father. He does his job very well, after all he´s in the business for quite a while now. There's also a surprise guest from a previous Marvel movie (I won't name him or her separately), but I've rarely seen such a pointless character in a movie. This character is only there so that Marvel and Kevin Feige can say, ""Here's our fan service, baby!""

Director Destin Daniel Cretton, who has already made a name for himself in the film business, certainly had the best intentions, as did his talented cameraman Bill Pope (who has already worked for the ""Matrix"" sequels or Sam Raimi's ""Spider-Man"" films), but in the end Marvel and Disney seem to have too much say and want their product to be suitable for the masses. And if you're not a Scorsese or a Nolan, then it's not so easy to get your vision through.

One last word to the composer Joel P West, who wrote a (sometimes) beautiful score with Asian influences. In the action, however, the whole thing quickly seems very unimaginative ...

Conclusion: ""Shang-Chi"" has finally shown me that Marvel is slowly becoming trivial. It was almost clear that after ""Endgame"" practically nothing could really astonish us anymore, but there was still hope with me. But precisely this hope is crumbling right now. Great action alone is not enough for a film to convince me and ""Shng-Chi"" is the best proof."
Completely different from the comic.,
Cheesy pulp for 12 year olds,Have I missed something? All these glowing reviews but I found this rather clichéd and the script lacking in any originality. It starts off watchable but descends into a sluggish tiresome holed plot line. Lots of lazy writing with one dimensional characters. The action is credible at the start (bus scene) but then becomes stupid and just CGI nonsense. Such a shame as this had huge potential at the start but quickly became rather childish and unentertaining.
Loved it.,"It's a nice classic Marvel movie with great imagery, funny moments, and epic fighting. It was candy to the eyes and was wholesome to watch. I wasn't sure about the cast picked but after watching this and getting to know the characters portrayed they absolutely work. You know how the first Iron Man and Thor movies made you feel? This movie is like that. Not too many side plots, no going down the rabbit hole trying to keep up with this and that. This was a straight story line with great character building. While there is a ton of CGI I felt it wasn't overly done; it was used when needed and was not overbearing. I have to give props the Awkwafina, as well. She did a great job keeping up with the heavily driven scenes. She was still her funny self but she knew when to pull back on her signature funny schitck and played out the serious/low key scenes to perfection. This was a good role for her and I hope to see her in the next Shang-Chi movie."
Great Superhero movie,"Great visuals, nice story, excellent fight scenes, fun moments, and mysteries for the future. Just everything needed in a Marvel movie. Marvel did it once with Black Panther, and now does it again with Shang Chi. Mixing superhero movie into a cultural environment. Just great!"
Excellent!,"Excellent and visually stunning. The characters, though new to us, are well developed and I can't wait to see more of them. Many humorous moments throughout the film, and yet it is still emotional and heartwarming. A great introduction to the new Marvel era."
"Fun, but hardly Ambitious or Groundbreaking","I didn't get to see this in theaters but I don't think that would alter my perception of this movie. On the outside it well made and well acted and an enjoyable film. However it has some issues and for me, didn't live up to the hype. Basically it's a Jackie Chan movie where Jackie Chan is played my Simu Liu and Chris Rock is played by Awkwafina. And suddenly (or not) mysticism. It almost doesn't feel like a traditional Marvel Movie. If it weren't for the ""surprise"" cameos here and there, and the almost laisez fare comment referring to Avengers: Endgame, you'd be hard pressed to believe it is one. Again it's fun, but not original."
Not much of a legend,"This movie leaves a lot to be desired.

The CGI is mostly well done, although not consistent throughout, with some pretty bad moments as well.

The action scenes are nicely done, but after the umpteenth martial arts fight scene, I have to admit, it grew a bit weary on me.

The story, while not truly bad in itself, is thin as paper and meanders along for too long, making the total runtime about half an hour too long in the process. It's also way too Disney; that new, not so good kind.

It's all pretty generic in the end, seemingly providing a sort fan service (or quite frankly pandering) to the Chinese audience more than anything else, by trying to cram as much Chinese mythology and history in it as possible. But also just as many stereotypes and clichés. It's all very shallow and it even went into shameless territory a couple of times, which is just weird.

Acting is decent to good, but the woman playing Jar-Jar Binks, no I mean Legolas, no I mean Katy, got annoying real fast.

With everything they had at their disposal to make a great movie, this sure could have been a whole lot better.

6/10, barely."
actors deserved better,"This is just bad, mummy 2 bad. Lifeless empty floaty cgi , like the cgi you'd get in a computer game cut scene from 15 years ago with the actors green screened badly into shot. Then there's the script and a racing poorly paced story. Even if the actors were giving their all it couldn't save this ...I might've rated this higher if I hadn't already had to watch black widow this year ...not to mention crap like mortal kombat and snake eyes its on that level just stop marvel, take some time off think about your product and come back strong ."
FANTASTICO MOVIE,"An awesome movie.

Must watch Storyline was really good and Action was extremely Mind blowing.

And Love the Acting.

Actors were Fabulous.

Wont regret after watching this Beauty."
Average,
Just another Marvel movie,"In no way, this marvel movie differs from what they are creating lately. Great CGI, little of any story, some randomly placed jokes that are mostly not at all funny, bunch of random action and fantasy with no limitations to its imagination.

Jokes by Awkwafina are terrible, I find her extremely unpleasent to watch, like kevin hart i find it so forced and unnatural, jokes are terrible and not at all suited for the moment. Unnecesearily taking the focus of the plot.

Story plot is so basic, when you look back at what happened in the movie, yeah, nothing much happens really, it is like 3 proper events and rest is just to prolong the movie for no reason.

Things that happen action wise in the movie, arent quite connected and I often got a feeling something happens out of nowhere, it can be predicted always, but still it is not logical for it to happen actually, it is just that to plot is so obvious that you know such illogical action will happen.

And personal touch to it, I prefer when fantasy has its limitations as well, when you know what characters are capable of in that fantasy world, I really dont like when all of sudden some character pulls of superpower move or some other capability that was never earlier mentioned or done, and that move just changes everything makes him beat everyone."
Below marvel standard,
Super Amazing Movie,I enjoyed every bit of this movie. The story was original the acting was super good it had some emotional and funny moments. It's just a super fun movie to watch. By the way i adored the dragons.
Not worthy,"Not particularly impressed with the latest Marvel offering as it was bereft of any immersive storyline. Trevor was an unnecessary inclusion and, along with Wong, felt like they were simply there as a reminder of the good old days, or 'have some familiarity while you bear with us until we get things back on track'.

The worst part however was the latest reminder of the Hollywood insistence that movies require a comic relief. Katy is a terribly written character, who tags along with nothing to offer and is actively encouraged to do so. She is portrayed by an unconvincing actress who would be better suited to lightweight teen comedies where constant OMG! Facial expressions are warranted.

I have serious doubts for the longevity of the studio now that the ""big guns"" have all but been phased out."
Fire whoever picked the music,"Whoever picked super bad hiphop/rap for this movie should leave the industry.

There are som great hiphop/rap that could haver worked a lot better if you had to pick that kind of music for this movie.

The asian scores obviously worked like they should.

Anyway movie had some nice moments thought all main asian female leads did a solid job,

Simu Liu didnt work for me as the main dude, a bit of meh .

With decent action scenes and solid humour scenes i gave it a 6."
quite a disappointment,"I am surprised all those ""suspicious"" good review, i m falling asleep and can't even pay attention most of the time. Somehow the mandarin in the movie is weird, is like watching an incrediblely old chinese movie trying to hit international with a bunch of westerners in the movie. This is by far the worst of MCU movies... some of the chinese cast doesn't even speak Mandarin/English as mother language, the languages in the movies is quite irritating while they keep swapping in between both languages or may be marvel doesn't care the way they speak does effect the experience while the audience watch it. I guess the best scene is just the action part and the CG without anyone talking...."
"Average storyline, predictable, nothing creative","The storyline is predictable. There was nothing innovative or creative in the story.

The visual effects were very good but again nothing out of the ordinary based on similar such movies.

You can watch it for one time but nothing to leave you impressed.

The actors have done a great job but they were not backed by an engaging storyline."
Marvel is becoming Apple now,"Marvel is becoming now Apple. No matter what you'll buy there products and have to say nicer even you can buy same kind of products somewhere else. Now this movie disappoints me so many places.

First of all storytelling, I don't know when the story start and where it goes. Somehow I felt It takes unnecessarily emotional point. I can't say I am fully disappoint There are Lot of good action scenes. Very good acting, very good VFX. The only missing is nice story, this story not convinced me properly. I can only give 5 out of 10 ratings but because Of marble franchise and I believe Their future that's the reason I give 6 out of 10 ratings."
Finally a Good Marvel movie,"Finally a Good Marvel movie. Was sick of nonsensical movies by Marvel and DC since long with dad jokes type of dialogues and no concrete storyline or material like Avatar. But I liked this one. Maybe Hollywood should make an Indian Avatar based movie, that would be exciting like some old Indian Gods mythology type of movie. As Bollywood really sux when it comes to making such movies, they're only good at making good biopics."
Best mainstream movie of 2021,"This movie was all around amazing. The visuals were amazing, it was a very heartfelt story and Simu Liu's and Tony Leung's performances were truly extraordinary.

I didn't give it 10 stars because the final battle felt a little underwhelming in comparison to the rest of the movie (something I have noticed is a common theme in Marvel movies).

Would honestly give it a 9.5."
Not The Usual,Shang Chi is a breath of fresh air. Shang Chi truly shows us the beauty of Martial Arts. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen.
Shang-Chi Review (9/11/2021),"This is the first movie to see in theaters since Covid-19 and let me tell you something, the movie is visually stunning and I mean the graphics, cinematography, and the colorful nature of Macau. The acting was great and had some heart (better in my opinion than Black widow) especially Simu Liu, Awkwafina, Meng'er Zhang, Tony Chiu-Wai Leung, and Michelle Yoeh. The soundtrack was very good. The film has some morals (something that I like to have in movies) like family and history protection, and the Asian issues in America. At the end, it's a very good movie to see in theaters with family. I give the movie 10/10."
Typical Marvel Film,First of all I have to say that the action sequences of this movie were great and it's cinematography was on point. The REAL Mandarin aka shang chi's father is easily the best marvel villain for me. Plus it was refreshing to see the ten rings in action. The story was good but I wish there were some changes in the script to make the movie more interesting as it got a bit slow in the second half. The climax was a bit dramatic. There were some moments which could have been better if the script was right. In the end as a marvel fan it's a great film but as a Superhero fan who isn't really into particular studio can find this movie an okayish one.
At least it looks stunning,"A movie with clear and crisp visuals that blends Chinese Kung Fu with CGI to perfection, but this seems to come at a cost of a weak and underdeveloped plot with misplaced priorities that prevents the audience from investing into the characters."
Great movie but ok marvel movie,
Such a visual treat,"This movie is by no mean nothing more special than a standard marvel movie. But where this story flawed the acting, villain, comedy and visual was amazing. Loved this movie and felt like something new, something fresh."
A great addition to the MCU,"By far my favourite Marvel Movie of all time. Great story, great actors, great visuals and overall a great experience.

I just wish I had the ability to forget it all, only so I could watch it again not knowing the what will happen next."
Shang Chi review:Marvel's take on Chinese culture,"Plus: Tony Leung perfomance Action sequences Climax portion Chinese representation Emotional weight

Minus: Dull and routine start of first half Less intriguing scenes Hero portion not much elevated No proper backstory for 10 rings

Verdict:A decent watch for audience and visual treat for fans....."
Supperrr CGI and Cinematography,This movie has it all nostalgia(Shaolin) + Ninjas+ Very good Graphics+ Comedy+ Action.
A typical but entertaining marvel movie,"As it's quite clear that marvel has a standard formula of making origin stories which is exactly what it has done in Shang Chi. The story doesn't have much to offer but the action sequences, vfx and the performances of all the actors make it an exciting watch. Another best thing is the new world it introduces, just like how they did in Black Panther.

P. S. - one extra rating for the post credit sequence 🙊"
Spoilers: Beautiful....but...,
Marvel did just fine,"It's a really good superhero movie, marvel doesn't disappoint. As always.

A little deus ex machina at the end spoiled it a bit for me but it's not a big deal."
MY NEW FAVOURITE MARVEL MOVIE!!!,"This movie is worth watching, marvel has a funny way of connecting the storylines of other MCU films. The fight choreography and CGI is above standards and the story line is superb! Amazing film."
Ten Rings out of Ten,
ASIAN REP!,"Tony leung carried the entire show, I hope everyone outside of Asia and who are not Chinese hope they know how lucky Hollywood was to have him in a Hollywood film. You can compare the lack of charisma from simu lu when you have them together in scenes. Even awkwafina did a better job than simu, but good job for them finally creating a decent movie for asians representation!"
Good but kind of exaggerated,"I'm a marvel huge fan and unfortunately I could not watch black widow in theaters so right after it came out I went to watch Shang-Chi. What can I say, I got out from the cinema very excited at first but still kind of disappointed- it looks like a disney live action more than a marvel movie... I have nothing to say about the special effects and combat scenes though, those were amazing.

Anyways, I can't say I wasted my money because it's still a nice movie, but I know that some people might not like it because it doesn't even seem to be a marvel movie."
Good but not best,Honestly its good movie. But it is not the best one . I expected much but it not full fill my expectations. There is not any twists. One time watchable movie thats all.
Predictable Chinese storyline. All hail Awkwafina & Wong!,"I really wanna do the Michael Pena summary, but here's a MUCH shorter version:

So its like a Joy of Luck Club mini reunion, but then there's this parkour on crack session... but then they ride Mr Weasley's enchanted car to this Chinese Wakanda, and then ride Mulan's Mushu to fight the Chinese Kraken and save the world... and basically Awkwafina and Wong steal the show! Welcome to the hotel Californiaaasa!"
Awesome,"Great action fantasy adventure with a compelling story arc. The storyline is great, a compelling villain, and an amazing marvel origin story. Great comedic timing, great cinematography, and amazing fight sequences. The music in this was perfect for the movie and the character arc. A satisfying and awesome climax. A great action film to watch."
BEST MCU Movie!!!,"Best mcu movie ever best fight scene.!!

A different style of mcu movie."
One of the best Marvel films to date,"I went in with a moderate expectation thinking this movie would be the typical predictable DIsney film. But I was wrong and blown away both by the complex story line AND the FREAKING AWESOME choreography martial arts. The film is exciting from the beginning, the acting and the chemistry between characters are captivating, especially between Shang Chi and Katy. The cinematography is flawless. Thoroughly enjoyed the movie. 10/10."
Great action!!,"I love this movie!! A great mixture of flying kung fu movies and MCU cinematic movies. I recommend it to all, please stay for the end credits (if you didn't know this already)."
Something different in a movie,This movie is a must see of 2021. It's has a great story and I am willing to see it again. Words can't describe how good it was.
crime drama meets Alice in Wonderland...stunning,"If Mario Puzo or Truman Capote were to write a fantasy it would feel like this. Or if Lewis Carroll were to write a crime drama it would feel like this. ""Shang Chi"" is, in essence, this sort of fascinating, singularly unique and audacious combination wrapped up in a wildly entertaining martial arts film. ""Shang Chi"" feels like no other MCU production because of this interplay of seemingly dissimilar elements. But, where else could one possibly come across such an engrossing mix than in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, where a raccoon once sent e-mails to a Russian assassin? That's the beauty of ""Shang Chi;"" it propels quite enthusiastically and energetically into this vast inexplicable new terrain which only Stan Lee and his fellow artists and creators could have envisioned or foretold. An extraordinary offering from Marvel Studios, ""Shang Chi"" is a must-see!"
Tony Leung upgrades it to another level! Actions are good.,"I am not interested in popcorn movies at all. However, when I knew that Tony Leung is one of the main cast. I gave my last chance to Marvel.

The fight scenes mix with styles from Ip Man, Kung-Fu...., this movie reached 80% of the standard. Especially for the fight between Wen-Wu and his wife.(Which is shown in the trailer)

Also the plot is better than normal MCU movies. At least there is a all-round character description for Shang-Chi and other role players. Fair performance from every actor. However, Tony Leung(Wen-Hu) shown why he is the best actor of Cannes. Every move, eye-contact, voice is well-designed. He creates WenWu himself. (It has to give credit to the director also) He shown the reason why WenWu did those bad things.

After all, Shang-Chi is a superhero movie. Description would not be detailed as the movie which Tony Leung casted normally. However, as one of the Tony's fan. It is a breakthrough for him. He seemed enjoyed from the interviews. Hope can see the background of WenWu in another movie."
Absolutely Awesome 😎!!,"Totally different from usual super hero movies.

Just great and awesome."
A beautiful fantasy treat.,
A real masterpiece,"Great action, great sci-fi, great scenario Another wonderful movie just has been added to the MCU."
Very awesome 😍,Very good movie and one of the amazing marvel series keep going 💪🏼💪🏼😍
well done!,"Very enjoyable! Visuals and action sequences were amazing, storytelling was well done."
Ya,
VERY GOOD!,"In short, you will enjoy it. In long, well you should go and see it yourself as there are a lot to talk about :) I first thought the dragon might make me not like the movie. I was wrong! I am usually not a fan of dragon but I liked this one (or I can say didn't hate it). I hope you have fun too :)"
A fantastic film 9/10,As someone who loves martial arts movies I think that Shang-Chi was a beautiful homage to the classics while also introducing a newer take with its ties to Marvel as well as including modern Asian American experiences. Personally it is one of my top Marvel movies!
Exceeds expectations!,"I did not have high expectations for this movie. Like many, I wasn't familiar with this hero going in.

That being said, the choreography in action scenes was PHENOMENAL. Definitely the highlight of the film for me.

If you're a fan of film, you will enjoy this beautiful movie."
The best marvel movie (and better than any marvel show) since endgame,My boyfriend and I saw Shang-Chi during the in the late afternoon (3pm to be exact) so we missed all the rush. Anyways this movie is really the best since I saw endgame back in 2019. The story is great and the special effect/cgi is amazing. It is a bit hard to follow at times since there's so much going on in the scene. I highly recommend this movie for any marvel fans out there!
Great movie easy marvel film to follow for many,"Epic fight scenes without too much visually clutter like most marvel movies great actors funny moments impressive characters and backstories

And the best part,Wong."
Shang Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings - A decent flick from MCU but not as great as expected...,"Shang Chi is a visual treat.. It has great acting, great visual effects but it lacks on screenplay in the 2nd half.. The 1st half was so good, I was enjoying the movie very very much with great martial arts and comic timing from Awkwafina.. The bus fight scene was just amazing!!! So good!! After the 1st half is done.. the movie went downhill.. It could have been better but still it was decent.. Anyways Shang Chi And The Legend Of Ten Rings serves the purpose of entertainment and we can say that Marvel Studios never disappoint us with their movies..

7.7/10 ⭐"
Too much of everything,"This movie doesn't really know what it is supposed to be. A Drama? A Fantasy flick? A Superhero Movie? A Bromance? A Comedy? It tries way too hard to appeal to every possible viewer. That is why it achieves nothing. It started well with some really awesome martial arts scenes, but then the story got more and more confusing. There were more holes in the plot than in Swiss cheese. For instance, a 14-year old trained assassin apparently got bullied at school - really?? And WHY was this guy who played a British actor even in the plot? The moment he showed up was the moment I was done with that movie. And then there were the over-the-top magical creatures who probably were supposed to get some ""awwws"" from the female audience. But the most disappointing thing to me was, that the more interesting and more badass sister got treated the way women typically get treated in Hollywood: she got totally ignored. Why did the male hero get all the rings? She did deserve at least half of them. It's male storytelling at its finest. As usual."
Typical Awesome Marvel Movie,Typical Marvel Movie- Lots of Action & Laughs. I saw this in IMAX and loved it! If you are a Marvel fan you will enjoy this movie. 2 extra credits so stay until the end.
Really bad power scaling,
Marvel Asian Superhero!!!,"I Love Shang-Chi!, This is Amazing Marvel Superhero Asian Movie, The Ten Ring Reference Showing in Iron Man 1,2 and 3, Marvel One Shot & Ant-Man, Mandiri Character was Amazing has Previously on Iron Man 3, And Visual Fighting So Awesome!! (Also Including Abomination & Wong)

Rating: 9/10."
Original!!!,"From the chemistry between Simu and Awkafina to the fact that Shang chi doesn't fall far from the mandarin tree it's just such a fresh take on a ""super hero"" movie, he knows what needs to be done and he doesn't have conflict he makes a choice and acts on it they really showed a true strict upbringing that made this Character so different to other Marvel heroes who have an internal struggle and Shang makes the hard decisions! Absolutely loved it and I want to see more of their universe and that's new cuz I usually say can't wait to see them in avengers, Katy and Shang need wedding bells I've never wanted a couple more than these two."
Tony Leung makes the movie,
Enjoyable,"Good action, good fighting, good visuals. The obvious comedic relief of the movie was actually a good character, Awkwafina was very enjoyable here. In all this new Marvel movies I always wonder where are all the other super heroes and why are they not helping, but here it makes sence bc is a personal sotry, not an alien invasion or mega mobs. I rated with a 7, I think it's fare, nothing groundbreaking."
Better than expected,"I thought it was just another junk Chinese movie but it turned out to be not bad. I was surprised to see so many famous actors and actresses there. The topic and style are interesting. Remind me some other films like they borrowed from but I can't tell which ones. Some similarities but not exact copy. Then I realized it's marvel movies. Understandable. Ending is typical marvel hero thinking. Overall, not bad for a Chinese version of marvel movies."
The story is,"Kinda meh, but i like how everything reminds me of a well made kung-fu movie but with marvel's sfx budget. Still better than ant-man, but not as good as wakanda."
Good. Not great.,This is most definitely worth the watch. The action isnt over the top predictable. Its enjoyable. This even has a tie in to the Marvel Uni so this can go places.
Entertaining and fun,"I think the best way to describe this movie is The Matrix meets Kung Fu Panda

This is a great movie! The action sequences are spectacular and even though there is lot going on in them, unlike some other epic battle scenes in movies where you lose track of what's happening, these are filmed in such a way that it's really easy to follow and make out what's going. The cinematography is spot on with plenty of slow motion which is just as well because the speed these guys move is phenomenal and breath-taking at times. Bruce Lee would approve.

The acting is good all round and the characters a good and relatable to. Over all it's a visually spectacular experience and all fans of Marvel or martial arts will enjoy it."
A good origin movie,It's a good entry for this new character. It's a bit cheesy but it's fine. Has some good vfx as well. Best character is katy. She holds up many moments.7.5/10 from me. Pretty enjoyable movie.
Good time pass movie,"Compared to other MC movies this one is ok. It is hard to come up with so many heroic stories, super powers, and scripts. So with that in mind it is still a good movie. It was good to watch with family as well. Starting of the movie was little different and waiting to see how it connects to entire movie as it happens was interesting."
Blew me away!!,"I'd only just seen Spider Man: No Way Home when I decided to stay in the Marvel Universe and watch this. WOW! This blows Spider-Man and the convoluted and confusing multiverse out of the water. This was fresh, fantastic and unexpected with a bit more depth than the usual Marvel flick (most all of which I love). The acting and action/fight scenes were excellent. A great mix of family drama and some fine humor to lighten certain periods of the film. I didn't want it to end. Highly recommend! I gave it a 10 because it was a stunning watch for us even at home and because IMO it's one of the top tier MCU films."
Shang-Chi,"Great action sequences and visual effects throughout, likeable characters, especially Tony Leung as Wenwu. Definitely one of the best mcu villains. Absolutely great action and choreography, best hand to hand combat scenes in the mcu after the winter soldier. However the movie just went downhill after the first half of the movie. Definitely could have been much better. Should have been better."
Bom,"Nessa analise me baseei em 5 importantes pontos: Enredo, desenvolvimento, personagens, estética e entretenimento.

Enredo: 1/2.

Desenvolvimento: 1/2.

Estética: 2/2.

Personagens: 2/2.

Entretenimento: 2/2."
Fun!,"Sure it is over the top at times. It's a cartoony fantasy movie.

And a well-made one at that!

Not a huge fan of the last end credits scene (why does there always have to be a set-up for a new conflict), but it is what it is."
Visually Stunning!!,"Well definitely the best production by marvel following Endgame. An absolute treat to watch. The main attraction is obviously the amazing fight sequence that's up there with the best fight scenes of MCU, and also the background music is perfectly fitting to the tone and setting of the film. What many might think that the plotline does not have enough depth. But I'd beg to differ as the way they've changed the Shang Chi character, introducing his father as the wielder of the ten rings and changing the power of the rings altogether is an amazing approach itself. The merging of different components and changing the storyline from the comics has been common in the MCU but none of them is as unique as shang chi. I'd say if they brought the original shang chi from the comics, then it would've been a mediocre movie. But they made every character unique, even the villain has a backstory to which everyone can relate. The fight sequences give goosebumps everytime I watch 'em. Can't wait for the sequel!!!"
Wonderful film,"I would like to say that this is just a fantastic movie. The film has a lot of colors. An interesting and cool plot. The actors have worked out their roles to the fullest. Leaves pleasant emotions after viewing. I advise everyone for an evening in a pleasant company or family circle, 10/10."
The movie exceeded my expectations,
good,".. Suddenly, unexpectedly, and before us is one of the best creations of Marvel in its entire modern history, lasting already 14 years! A colorful, interesting, tasty, emotional, spectacular and bright spectacle should not leave anyone indifferent with a 'plus' sign, even though this character is not named...

.. By 2021, the 'Marvel' projects have reached such grandeur and scale that local producers can afford to experiment with certain characters unknown to the mass audience, but probably known to ardent fans of this huge comic book universe. 'The Eternals', 'Shan-Chi'... How many more new movie characters and new surprises are waiting for us?! Of course, it is difficult to say, however, given the frank failure of the first and the success of the second, everything is not so simple here! We will dwell on the second in more detail (for obvious reasons)!! ..

This film, which is more than 2 hours long, tells us about such magical accessories as 10 rings, which give their owner unknown power, strength and immortality. At the same time, family joy/tragedy/joy is unfolding before us with numerous rather big flashbacks to the past, where the same 10 rings play a central role, without which, as judging from the title of the tape and its viewing, we will not get anywhere! As it turned out, we are in for a bit of fantasy and mysticism, a couple of familiar characters from previous 'Marvel' projects, a certain secluded area like Wakanda (only now with an Asian tint), as well as a colorful spectacle and, in principle, a very, very high-quality film ..."
Cool,
best marvel movie ever,
Review,"Fast paced, energetic, and relentless, not particularly the genre I normally go to, or enjoy, but I loved every second of it, a visual masterpiece. Superb acting, terrific musics, but it's produced in such a magical way, it is stunning."
Very good even,"Like many Marvel films, Shang-Chi's film turned out great. The acting is just great. But the actors themselves, in my opinion, are chosen not quite correctly. In place of the main character, I wanted to see a strong, pumped-up person, and not a strong ""Pukhlyash"". But in general, if you do not find fault with the actors, then the plot of the film is done cool, even with strange moments that you do not expect at all, such as meeting with a headless animal, which additionally creates interest.

Watching a movie creates a certain tension, because it is not clear what can happen next. And this mystery in the film also gives a certain zest."
God,
Legend...,"The film ""Shang chi and the legend of the Ten Rings"" is quite dynamic, there are a lot of special effects.

The film combines science fiction, fantasy, action, adventure. I like such films, because you immediately tune in to miracles and the unreality of events.

The elements of humor in the film are also visible, there are funny moments.

The plot of the film is interesting, in my spirit, the only thing missing was a smoother transition of an ordinary fighter into a superhero, as the reincarnation happened quickly.

The film is directed by Destin Daniel Cretton. The film itself is from the USA and Australia. Marvel Studios. The film lasts more than two hours, but it looks in one breath.

The plot jumps into the past in periods, revealing the biography of the hero.

Summing up, I want to say the film was very interesting to watch and not boring. A very beautiful fairy tale movie. There was a little lack of plot revealing moments, though then it would have stretched for all three hours, if not more, but for me it would have been better to let it stretch.

Therefore , I advise you to look !"
Good,
Great film.,"I really enjoyed the soundtrack, I thought it was a beautiful mix of modern and traditional music. The film itself was very well done, the CGI and animation was great as well as the acting. The story line and origin story was very though out and was very interesting."
the movie is good,
neutral opinion,
Everyone else -,
Marvel and Asia,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Idin of the most interesting films, telling about the adventure of an Asian-born super hero in the Marvel cinematic universe. The main character is waiting for a large number of secrets concerning his family. Together with their friends, they go in search of the truth. I advise you to watch this movie picture. She will not let you get bored during the entire session. The convulsions and dynamic scenes going back to the time of old China are very well demonstrated."
Norm,
Wow what a movie,"Hello One of the Best movies of this year I really enjoyed watching and i wish to see more of it.

Maybe the 2 and 3 of this movie please Wish you the best and the luck for more.

. Thanks keep the hard work."
The best Marvel movie yet?,"I delayed watching this for a long time, thinking it would be some cheesy, Hollywood ""chop-suey"" fiasco ... but ... wow, was I mistaken!

I should have known better, seeing that Tony Leung and Michelle Yeoh have starring roles.

I'm finding it hard to remember a Marvel movie better than this. Maybe that's a pointless exercise, since they're all very different (mostly).

Whatever, this is well worth watching. The CGI is some of the best I've seen, and it actually blends pretty well with the live action (not always the case with other movies). The fight scenes are beautifully choreographed, in the Hong Kong style (with a nod to Jackie Chan in the first half). The creature battle at the end is a masterpiece of visual effects.

The character development is fairly standard (father/son), but done do well it doesn't really matter. Simu Liu and Awkwafina are perfectly cast, and bring a well balanced comedic touch overall.

Really very impressed. My faith in Marvel has been (partially) restored."
a little predectable,"All in all it was a good Marvel movie, not a great one, but still very good and very entertaining. Shaun and Katy were a great best buds duo with some fun interactions. Ben Kingsley's reprise as the Mandarin was hysterical. He's got such range and doesn't take himself too seriously and that makes him perfect.

Great fight scenes, ok origin story, but a little predictable unfortunately.

Hopefully the next movie will get a little more attention to keeping the audience guessing at least a little.

Watch and enjoy, even if you see it coming."
Great action.,"The best thing about this film is the choreography. It. Is. Amazing. Except for that, the story is decent, characters are fine, and it's nice to see some good Asian representation. Altogether not a bad movie."
Another Acceptable MCU Film,"While I wouldn't sit for a rewatch, Shang-Chi was a fine feature film. The action sequences we're for the most part solid, highlighted by an early duel between two masters of martial arts which took great inspiration from the light and flowing fights of traditional Asian movies a la ""Crouching Tiger"". On the other end of the spectrum was the rushed and dull car escape about two-thirds the way through. Many other parts of the movie fell along a similar spectrum: our protagonist and his sister were rich and flowing characters, while their friend Katy and much of the supporting cast felt rushed and dull. Additionally, the movie spends a significant amount of time painting lore and background knowledge while skirting around essential questions, like, ""What is the function of the 10 rings?"" ""What is the prejudice between Xu Wenwu and the residents of Ta Lo,"" and ""Did Shang-Chi actually get stronger in his late training sequence?"" The writers seem to feel that a lot of things needed to happen for the movie to work, and while the rush between characters, moments and events isn't clumsy, it is rarely very satisfying."
Good Job Marvel,"While moving away from the main storyline this movie doenst feel like a quick cash grab but a full fledge story with lots of work and study behind. The universe gets even more depth when we notice the references to tradicional chinese culture even in the middle of the fight scenes its possible to notice reference to chinese dramas where we have long flight moments when the receive some kind of impact, so yeah.

Where is the second movie."
First impression,Flawless. Inspirational. Happiness. Tears. Marvel Redemption?!?!?!?! Dragons!!!!!!!! I will amend tomorrow an when in full minded review mode (sober) so yeah! Appreciation!!! Need some characters lol.
"Fun movie, but not very different from other MCU movies","I watched this with very high expectations, especially after John Campea and Robert Meyer Burnett gave it glowing reviews.

But while they felt it was amazing, it seemed like a standard MCU film to me. It was fun, but felt like a lot of other MCU films to me. I thought there would be more mythology explored, but it felt too brief to me.

Overall, a good film, but didn't feel great."
Solid film- unique for a CBM,"This is not your typical CBM (comic book movie) whilst watching I actually forgot I was watching a MCU/Marvel movie. This is more like a Bruce Lee or Crouching Tiger type film

The film's setting is unique as is the style and story. The story is quite weak at points but it keeps you entertained. The acting was great although Awkwafina's character (Kathy) does get quite irritating at times. The fight choreography is amazing as is the VFX and OST

Overall, the film caters to all audiences."
Could've been better!,"It's nice to see the colors inverted. In this movie we can see the red (good) fighting the blue (bad). The movie can have more potential in it. It's an unpopular oppinion that some of the actor's performance is poor.

We as Marvel fans have been waiting a long time for this, and it's sort of disappointing by my oppinion."
Loved it overall,"I really enjoyed this movie. The actors were really strong. I liked the fight scenes. It's about time Marvel had some martial arts with an Asian background in it. The plot was good and seemed to flow well. The humour was good. They tied it in well with some post endgame comments and hidden things in the background. I really hope they continue with this movie and possibly a new Avengers movie. The only parts I didn't like were minor and it's toward the end, but I'm not spoiling it. It is definitely worth watching though. I want to watch again."
Marvel got this one right!,"Shang-Chi is one of those movies that starts off strong and never stops entertaining you. From the beginning, I felt connected to the characters and the story made sense.

Shang-Chi had just the right amount of funny comments or jokes that you can still take it seriously, and at the right time, everyone was serious. I must admit, I had my doubts about Awkwafina when I saw her as the role of Katy, I was afraid she would crack jokes the entire move, but that's not the case. When the time was right, there was a joke, when the time came to be serious, she displayed her strong acting skills and carried her role perfectly.

Simu Liu was nothing short of perfection for me from start to finish, but to be honest, that's what I expected.

Both Tony Leung Chiu-wai and Fala Chen were incredible as well as the rest of the cast. Everyone played their part and played it well.

I feel like the movie was a great story and we took a great ride alongside the ten rings, their origin and progression of power. The father was a villain, but he had his reasons and was made to feel human.

I have no bad comments regarding this movie other than I don't want to wait a whole year to see part II."
Something to look forward to ..,"Yet to watch The Eternals and the new crop of characters into the MCU, but this is one I would definitely look forward to going forward ! Wonderful CGI apart , a comprehensive origin movie that blends well into the MCU."
"had potential, BUT....","If it was darker and more serious, it would have been fire!

I didnt like them comedy parts. Took big part of the movie, and even though i laughed, i would prefer the movie to be darker and more serious... it left me a disney vibe, kinda Mulan?

Choreography was A game... Amazing... also the last credit scene was gr8... overall - 6/ 10."
"Strong fight choreography, spoiled by middling story and way too much exposition","The fight scenes in this movie are very well choreographed, and there's some pretty good comedic moments too. It's a shame really that the rest of the film in between those scenes is either incredibly boring, an exposition dump or a mixture of the two."
Marvel does not disappoint.,
Over Rated,"All I say is that when I see a movie got 7.8/10, I expect a much more powerful story and unexpected plot twists. Even the fighting scenes were not good enough! Kongfu Panda fighting scenes are more natural :) Clothes design was awful but not as much as the story!

OMG! That was weak!!! I suggest this movie to under 13 y.o kids who like fake fights out of nowhere... Special effects were good. 👍"
STOP MAKING FUNNY MOVIES,"Funny scenes were unique in the beginning of the MCU era. Now, it is tedious and repetitive. We, as viewers and fans should demand more from those movies by posting reviews. We should seek better scripts, a decent story-no my just visual effects.

Marvel movies need a reboot. Unfortunately, this was another poor quality script. 5 stars for the visual effects..."
Seriously marvel I didn't expect this from you,"Very old boring story. Where you can predict everything. You need a new character in next movie and made this new Shang Chi character.

I am not sure why this movie got 7.5+ rating."
First misstake from Marvel,
A rough introduction.,"""You can't outrun who you really are"".

60/100

What Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings provides, besides a really long title, would be considered an exceedingly new perspective of what the MCU can offer. It's one of those marvel movies that, despite its defects, stands out from most superhero films, something almost impossible to do these days...

Marvel has a reputation of creating great origin stories for its characters, at least establish the basics of them, orderly making the audience sympathize with them. Shang-Chi is no exception. It establishes the future role of this character and its importance on the MCU, but a deeper analysis into his past must be needed in order to make him go through the good ol' hero's journey, something that the movie tried to accomplish, but was left incomplete while trying to prioritize some plot points.

That's another thing with this film: a sense of incompletion. It tries to set up so many aspects and characters that, it forgets to conclude anything :/. The final act doesn't help either; having some of the most horrible looking CGI I've ever seen in a Marvel proyect and tiktok-worthy green screen effects.

Maybe the character of Shang-Chi will leave me a better taste in my mouth as we see more of him in the future but, right now, it feels like a bumpy start to the introduction of a promising character.

Also, the funny tones hit surprisingly well..... huh, who would've thought I would say that about a Marvel film...."
Glad to see asian heroes and actors sadly in a lackluster story,"The fights are good if you are a fan of the old kung fu movies, the story is pretty flat and basic the character development and motivations are very simple and boring, if it was 20 years ago and with no MCU it would have been fine, but there are so many better superhero movies, keep making diverse movies I would also like to see a sequel just make it good, make me care about the great action. The characters are underdeveloped and the story is just basic and overdone, they could have a great family conflict if they only made the villain more complicated and could have saved the whole ending."
One Word for This Action Adventure Amazing!,"I watched it at home today and I felt that why did I miss it on Theatres. It's a amazing movie for the fans of fantasy genre. After watching this one I became a fan of fantasy genre movies. Guys go for this one, it will take you to the best magical world for an amazing roller coaster."
Razzle Dazzle....without Fu Manchu,"Decent action fantasy adventure, the asian twist give s it an uplift with over the top razzle dazzle.

However the Shang Chi storyline unfortunately is definitely not from the comics, pretty disappointed as Shang Chi is very sombre.chaacter who is at war with his father Fu Manchu who is a scheming powerful scary dude, the conflict between them is epic and forms the basis of the core of the storyline.

Dont think Shang Chi is a required not relevant chanracter in this movie, the requirement is just for an action hero, seems like Marvel ran out of ideas how to introduce Shang Chi to the audience."
Fantastic CGI & Good fight scene.,"Fantastic CGI & Good fight scenes but that where it ends.

Acting is weak and sometimes annoying, Story not catchy and some characters don't have anything to add.

Suffering like many other movies: Weak story."
Average storyline with stunning visuals,"Great VFX and cinematography but lacks in storyline. Cliche and highly predictable. One time watch. Expected a lot but ended up in disappointment . But as the first Asian superhero movie, this has done a fair job."
Shang chi and the legend of the ten rings,"This is a great movie with great fight scenes. However i didnt like the part with the mythical/mystical creature fights. The movie is kinda predictable in the manner that all marvel first films feature a villain with simmilar powers to the hero. Shang Chi has a sister and a friend and are going to meet his sister.

It is a story of family conflict and drama."
Mmmmm?,"It just missed the mark. It was certainly watchable , entertaining and enjoyable but for Marvel something wasn't right. Could have done more with Wong & Abomination . It was just a little too predictable and a certain character was almost Jar Jar Binks like but just saved in the end. Hopefully another in the future but with some more depth of character."
Shang-Chi it was made for me,"What it is is Wushu action entering Marvel Universe.

I you like martial arts classics from Asia this is a film for you. If you like action and creatures it is for you. If you like subtitles and mythology and want 2 hours of escapism go see this."
"Shang-Chi, Marvel's Black Horse","Shang-Chi is a movie that nobody expected. An exemplar with which we were not familiar that, not only knew how to exploit their low expectations to the maximum extent, but also developed a structured and dynamic narrative immersed in a MCU that does not leave much room for new heroes.

Shang-Chi made its first appearance in Steve Englehart and Jim Starlin's ""Special Marvel Edition # 15"" (December 1973). A Kung-Fu master created in the middle of the genre's boom in the US in the 1970s, Shang-Chi is quite a quirky character.

Played by Simu Liu, the protagonist is embarked on an adventure after being intercepted by ghosts from his past. Full of action, martial arts and a very own and attractive aesthetic, the film unfolds without delay. The scenes are punctual and always add something new. Even with a sense of humor that can get heavy on certain occasions (such as when Katy makes jokes in the middle of life and death situations), Shang-Chi finds its essence, exploits it and ends with a gold ribbon leaving the door open for future aftermath.

Marvel and its production team never cease to amaze me with their new films. In a difficult transition period, given the conclusion of the Infinity Saga and the beginning of this new phase, the studio keeps its feet on the ground and continues a coherent thread of its interconnected universe. Regardless of the obvious mentions to the events of ""Avengers Endgame"", Marvel returns to do what it does best: including thousands of references, cameos and winks that leave the geeks like me open-mouthed and with the greed for more.

The cast is incredible. I did not know any of the actors beforehand and they all dazzled me with their distinctive personalities and professional interpretations. The studio made a great work in synthetizing the oriental culture´s mythology and beliefs. However, it is true that Shang-Chi continues to be a westernized vision of Asian cultures due to its falls into stereotypes of martial arts and frequent characterizations of the Eastern world in Hollywood. Despite this and to my surprise, Shang-Chi knows how to combine the best of both worlds, using humor as its best tool and taking its time to tell the story, avoiding the rush to get to the action sequences that movies of this kind have suffered The protagonist's arc is round and fulfilling. It has cohesion and is true to its ideals from beginning to end. Thus, the villain (excellently played by Tony Leung) only contributes to the plot and does not fall into the corner of un-memorable Marvel villains. We send you a greeting, Fake Mandarin. If it hadn't been for the blessing acting skills of RDJ, no one would remember your existence.

Furthermore, the film interprets the concept of ""grays"" very well. In a franchise that is ""infantilized"" at times, Shang-Chi does not stutter in telling the hard truths of reality such as unsatisfactory employment, unreal family expectations, childhood trauma, the dilemma about murder, among others. Heroes are not pure white. They have their shortcomings, they fight with their demons and that makes them more credible, more human.

With a stellar sound-track, Shang-Chi is one of Marvel's most unexpected gems. It is amazing to feel and denote the love with which these films are made and the fidelity to the source materials. For example, the main character's leitmotif is a work of art and a composition that immerses us even more in the plot. Kevin Feige deserves all the praise, he is truly a man who knows how to sell his product very well and, at the same time, sell us something with great qualitative value.

After the post-credits scenes, fans only crave more and rejoice in the near future for what remains of this phase. Now with the recent release of the trailer for the new Spiderman movie, one only has to cross out the days for its premiere and admire the attention to detail that they put into the making of the films, not only as individual creations, but as a large adjoining and a special set of films. Bravo Marvel.

Postscript: I really love Benedict Wong. Is he the ultimate man?"
Top tier,
Well Done Marvel!,Movie all together is fabulous nothing is missing but last 30 minutes will make you go crazy!!
Shang chi,This movie was one of the best if not the best marvel movie so far.the acting is amazing and the fight scenes are great.
Worth a few watches,"Good film, great action, decent characters. More than worth a trip to the theater, maybe more than once."
Marvelous,"This is one of the best solo(origin) movie by Marvel.

I highly recommend you all to watch this fantastic movie only in theaters !

And Simu Liu just killed it!"
8 Rings out of 10,"For the first time in a couple of years, since 2019's ""Captain Marvel"" the MCU introduces us to a brand new hero. Simu Liu who, rather impressively, first asked for the role on Twitter brings us Shang-Chi in a film that perhaps does have some issues with it's ending, but ultimately is a fun, funny ride of the type Marvel have been perfecting for the last 13 years.

Talented, but somewhat aimless, Shaun (Simu Liu) lives in San Francisco working as a valet with his friend Katy (Awkwafina). When he's attacked on a bus, he's forced back into the world of his father, a ruthless terrorist Xu Wenwu (Tony Chiu-Wai Leung). First visiting his sister, then returning to the Ten Rings compound, Shang-Chi decides to use his skills to defend his late mothers sacred homeland against invasion from his father and for control of ten mystical arm rings, weapons that grant their owner immortality and unearthly power.

If ""Black Widow"" was considered a wobble for the MCU, despite the fact I thought that it's a perfectly fine film, then it was important to come back with something that was undeniably excellent. ""Shang-Chi"" was that. It's the perfect balance of humour and action that Marvel have established over the last few years. The action too is tweaked slightly, to more closely resemble the types of Asian led action films that we've seen previously, be that the Jackie Chan style bus fight, or the ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon""-esque flashback fight between Shang Chi's parents. There's some lovely links to the wider MCU, including a return for Benedict Wong's Wong and for Trevor Slattery, Ben Kingsley's ""Iron Man 3"" character whose masquerading role as The Mandarin was one of the MCU's most divisive moments.

It's not perfect. The ending is perhaps a little rushed and lacking a moment or two of redemption earning for Xu Wenwu, but the peaks at the future for the character, and for the 10 Rings organisation is an interesting addition, plus our first real step on what might be the route to the next big bad. Excellent stuff."
Fantastic if you don't know the comic story....,"Overall: 91/100

This is more geared towards non-Marvel people than for the Marvel people.

Quick & Dirty: I loved it and would highly recommend seeing this film in theatres. Visually stunning, fantastic fight scenes, great story, and emotionally driven. Due to one too many lulls perhaps a slight bit too long in length, but overall, very enjoyable.

When I was teen I loved watching Asian films such as ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", ""House of Flying Daggers"", & ""Ong-Bak"". This film had the great martial arts fighting sequences that the aforementioned films had. I felt like I was a kid again enjoying something fresh and new. I also fully enjoyed the combination of Mandarin (apologies if that's wrong) and English. A movie with subtitles always reminds me that there's more than the bubble of North American film.

The acting was great. Michelle Yeoh was the one who stole the show for me at the end of the day. Again, it reminded of the good old days of martial arts movies that depended on the actors to make things believable instead of lots of CGI.

I watch virtually zero Marvel movies and so if you're iffy on whether to watch this or not it shouldn't stop you from enjoying this film. It's funny, action packed, and does not appear to be culturally inappropriate. The acting is great and the length of the film, while a little long, is still exceptional.

PS... there are two after the credits scenes so make sure you have time sit until the very end.

Enjoy the show!"
A Marvel for the whole family.,"""The US government was almost toppled by a pretender named after an orange."" Wenwu (Tony Leung)

This quote is typical of the light-hearted but also serious addition to the MCU that is Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings. Although Marvel has always been less serious than DC, this time it leaves Superman and Batman to cry in their capes. Sweet superhero Sean/Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) has more humanity than almost any other hero, and he uses his martial arts only when pressed.

The opening sequence on a bus (you can see the bad coming from other cinematic bus rides such as in Nobody) is rousing and entertaining. It has a fight sequence I laughed through because of its ballet-like composition but satisfying because it sets up character and motivation.

When things get heavy, and they do because Sean must confront and potentially kill his 1000-year-old mobster dad, Wenwu, Awkwafina's Katy, Sean's girlfriend, is there with amusing one-liners throughout the adventure, right down to a life-saving shot in the big ending battle scene.

Director Destin Daniel Cretton deftly orchestrates his fights and his characters' lines with the authority of a much more seasoned filmmaker. He never loses sight of the central motif-the affirmation of family primacy, so that the potential chaos of a giant cast and multiple plot strands hosts a unity glued by character and dialogue.

Shang-Chi is a Marvel for the whole family and especially the cinephiles curious how The Marvel Cinematic Universe can be so diverse, so entertaining, and so perfect a purveyor of our heroic fantasies."
Gorgeous sceneries and beautiful choreography,I've seen this twice and going for a third time this weekend. The fight scenes are *chefs kiss*. You're living under a rock if you haven't seen this film yet!
Amazing,Amazing. My favorite marvel movie so far. Great choreography and acting. Perfect cast and non stop fun.
The Best Fight Club,"Shang-Chi is hands-down the best Asian representation film. It took a while for Marvel to make a martial arts film, and they certainly couldn't have done better by roping in Destin Daniel Cretton for his character-driven directing repertoire and Tony Leung - the master of Asian cinema - for his first English language role. The fight choreography is the highlight of the movie, while the newish cast - Simu Liu, Awkwafina and Me'gher Chang deliver memorable performances playing their action hero roles with a touch of humour. The film's climax - with dragons and monsters - feels somewhat cheesy after its brilliant first half, but hey it wouldn't be a Marvel movie without CGI monsters. Overall, Shang-Chi is a fun movie for multiple repeated viewings."
More of the same,"Kind of boring film. The premise is interesting, but kind of comedic all over and with little compromise with being convincing. I mean, Marvel films have this requirement for suspension of disbelief by default, but this film kind of explains very little and the character's interaction is shallow and not very meaningful. The end is predictable, everything looks artificial.

Perhaps we are all vaccinated against Marvel's all over the place magic to a point that everything looks familiar, boring and flat. Or perhaps the film is just not that great.

My big problem with this film is the bus sequence at the start. It eeps going downhill. I mean.. if you can make turns with the bus, why does it keep going down all the time? Turn left twice, it will go uphill instead of downhill and decelerate, then turn to any side and it should come to a standstill. Not very clever, guys."
"Marvel Should Have Stood Behind this ""Experiment!""",The ACTORS of this action film did NOT disappoint! I knew if it had Tony Chiu-Wai Leung and Michelle Yeoh it was going to be good! Simu Liu and Awkwafina were fantastic! They kept it traditional but also added a little modern flare to this kung-fu movie. Must see this movie IN THE THEATRE AND NOT SITTING ON YOUR COUCH!
Quite a surprise,
Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings just became one of my absolute favorites of the entire MCU!,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free thoughts, please follow my blog to read my full review :)

""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings just became one of my absolute favorites of the entire MCU! Destin Daniel Cretton delivers an entertainment-heavy movie with arguably the best action ever seen in the cinematic universe. Through the outstanding mix of long takes, impressive fighting choreography, and jaw-dropping stunt work, Simu Liu shines with his martial arts skills, but also in tackling the identity issues of the protagonist. Marvel gains yet another emotionally compelling antagonist, as well as a relatable female character that embodies many elements of the Asian-American culture. Despite an overreliance on unnecessary, excessive exposition devices (narration, flashbacks, foreshadowing), the story behind all the tales and legends never loses interest. From the breaking of stereotypes to a remarkable depiction of their culture, most Asian viewers will certainly love this film, even more than I do. Phase Four is off to a remarkable start...""

Rating: A-"
Incredible!,"Wow, what a stunningly beautiful movie. Incredible fight scenes, beautiful cinematography, amazing story and villain. Loved every minute of it. Marvel has done it again!"
More of the same,"Some of the action and fight scenes are eye candy but the movie is generic and boring. Every cliche from a kung fu/ fantasy movie is there, including flying dragons. Skip this one at all costs."
Just another Kung fu movie - Not Marvel Level,
Haters suck They're a plague,This movie was awesome. Any haters are simply doing it to disagree and be a loud voice. Plus I know for a fact most the haters take their opinions from someone else's review. They read some thing and decide that they don't like it before they even see it. Drives me crazy.
Worst Marvel movie by far,"This movie deserves my first IMDB review. I usually agree with critics and IMDB ratings, but this is ridiculous. Everything is so bad that I can't choose the worst part. I never had high expectations, but man, this sets the new low.

The characters, the acting, the dialogs, the CG, the monsters, the machete guy, the soundtrack, the costume, the design, the jokes, the ""cute"" animals, the MCU references, the bad guys, the good guys, the ""love"" story, the whole family drama, I can keep going... I think that even if all the problems described were fixed, the movie would still be bad because the story is completely nonsense. Unfortunately, it's a compilation of bad decisions.

If you were involved in the creation of this movie, my apologies. Good luck next time!

TL;DR - Don't waste your time, it's terrible. The fact that most of the audience liked it is beyond my understanding."
🤐🤐,The best possible start Also the worst possible ending The ugliness of the end cannot be described A kid can write a better ending than this ridiculous ending.
good entertaining and bollywood like,"Good entertaining and Bollywood like. It is loaded with action. Preferably watch on the biggest screen available.

Marvel's Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is much more than the trailer/teaser revealed! First ten minutes or so or so in chinese! And throwing a lot of chinese terms (slang?) in there as well - throughout! That gives it a touch of authenticity. How immigrants in America or anywhere else in the world grew up.

I think it's a good thing to have such a major and big representation of Asian characters, especially nowadays with Anti-Asian hate/crime rising. The film had a pure theatrical release, instead of the Black Widow treatment (which also was available on Disney plus and the cinemas at the same time) The movie does not have that as a topic, it is entertainment after all, but in every promo and interview that the actors were involved it was something that was mentioned. Now waiting for the other stuff to drop, especially after the mid credit scene, that is such a tease!"
"A beautiful film in every way, shape, and form","'Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings' is absolutely on my list of favorite Marvel movies. 2021 has been full of hyped up films that have ultimately left me disappointed, but this one lives up to every bit of its hype.

The action from beginning to end was some of the best I've seen in a Marvel movie or in general in a very long time. The choreography, especially when performed by Michelle Yeoh, Meng'er Zhang, and Fala Chen (and stunt doubles) felt like poetry in motion. Everything was done with so much grace and elegance that I did not want it to end. Simu Liu brought both charisma and charm as Shang-Chi while delivering some amazing action sequences too. He was nothing short of fitting for the role. And to my surprise ""Awkwafina"" was not as unbearable as I assumed she would be.

The movie does lose some momentum in the 3rd act as it slows down a bit and takes a deeper dive into the story, but quickly picks back up as you head into the final battle. The set and CGI used creates some breathtaking shots that adds to the greatness of the film.

Marvel fan or not this film is worth going to see."
One of the top 10 best Marvel movies,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is very different from all previous Marvel movies, which is a good thing. I was a little worried at first that the film might not live up to the success Marvel pushed to give, but the film was actually spectacular and very entertaining. Good story, good acting, excellent character development, the action and choreography are outstanding, some funny moments, beautiful cinematography, and the VFX are a major step-up from previous Marvel films. This film was almost like the Aquaman of the MCU because it was a fun experience seeing it on the screen and presenting fans with something entirely new and unfamiliar. This movie is practically flawless. Can't wait to see Shang-Chi in future Marvel movies."
Best Marvel movie to date.,"Very well done. Great writing, directing, and acting. Beautiful choreography and cinematography. Loved the costumes."
Opening of Phase 4!? Feels like the story writers and directors are lost...,It doesnt feel like a MARVEL movie at all!! Didnt like the movie... Felt like watching Fantastic Beasts and where to find them!! Boring Storyline.
Fala Chen's Character Saves This Dud,
Amazing and new!,Best Marvel movie in the recent times! Great action and just enough humour rather than the usual Marvel OTT. Strong character development makes them relatable and connected. Nice pace with beautiful fight scenes. Impressive overall!
Epic movie,"Marvel does a lot right, and a good fight scene is one of them. But this movie had battles and characters that are only available in the context of this new world and this story. Despite a ""classic"" and somewhat cliche story it brought me a lot of joy. Classics are classic for a reason right? Cliches are powerful in the right light. Also the post credit scenes! Yes! Marvelllllll you did it again."
Shang Chi,"Didn't know what to expect from this movie. But it didn't disappoint. It caught my eye. And when you catch a viewers eye, it means the movie did something right."
Highly entertaining,"Greetings from Lithuania.

""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" (2021) is definitely one of my favorite Marvel movies. I loved fighting scenes - this is first ting what separated this movie from the bunch. Also i liked the story (i haven't read comics). Acting was good by everyone. Action scenes (and there are plenty of them) were simply amazing. This is a one spectacular looking movie.

Overall, superbly paced at running time 2 h 5 min this movie never dragged. Special effects were amazing, as well as technical stuff of this movie including terrific cinematography. ""Shang-Chi"" is a superbly entertaining popcorn escapism."
Marvel fully enjoyable movie,"Shang-chi is a good and more than a marvel movie Its a combination of Black Panther and Thor Ragnarok Funny, Stunning action, visuals, great locations, and background score Simu lui has done a good job and he doesn't hesitate to bring his best performance and we need to talk about akwafina she is great as funny as Paul roud ...The conclusion: after watching we fell in love with Shangchi cast."
More of the same,"I wish marvel shows some balls with different genres. Had so many expectations from this movie. Wished its not yet another mediocre marvel movie. Half way through i felt indifferent.

Not gonna watch another marvel movie until they move the goddamn needle."
