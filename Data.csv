97,"thought movie would suck honestly heard made thought shang chi terrible character powers always dread hollywood making asian movies lol

im chinese way finally watched blown away best movie year maybe one best marvel movies didnt involve blockbuster teamup like avengers infinity wars end game

so action packed excellent script insane graphic visuals insane fighting choreography alot character depth explorations well made indeed black panther movie asians say asians chinese culture affected asian countries last  years

dont let reviews bother alot people dont know talking honestly seen  person mention villain movie takes villain indepth look every villain drive  purpose things villain involved love may able comprehend view villains stone cold killers maybe destructive emotion type baddies

they wrote script villain amazingly considering originally mandarin stereotypical villain hated asians clever way able remove racist heritage character flawless funny amazing

i mean cmon hilarious way villain described name came

some even complained got lost whole movie found hard believe mean must low iq lmao go understand n follow movie beginning end step step process maybe could explored magical lands whois say wont future movies u needed know movie questions saved future marvel movies always do

the fight scenes bus charts rest see many chinese people hating film cuz feel fighting style like chinese movies fighting style dont get made movie good amazing way blended chinese western movies together fight scenes neither chinese western perfect blend

this stories villajn writting way thanos better thanos crazy mad villain purpose feelings goals involved world domination killing villain tony leung may many lines movie way carried presence acting outstanding

i watched tony leung hong kong movies  years acting impeccable brought life villain played gave earth also relatable character portrayal anyone position movie would chance go path know many might disagree easy see deviated good path took time back evil need understand character reasons experiences

the main character sima liu mean pretty good choice scenes fighting looked stunts amazing

i seen complain movie mandarin thats clearly comment made someone china mandarin speaking live old age black black white white grey

only way asians move forward hollywood blend west n east

maybe people might hate cause much asian characters n got mandarin language u got others hate cuz english groups need grow live year  cuz movie successful mixture cultures 

if movie another straight chinese martial arts flick would certainly successful west blend makes open races watch enjoy

the special effects movie charts amazing fighting too

this movie black panther asians opening door asians introduced commonly

if anyone china reads think u think hard want see chinese movies succeed future cuz u ccheer movie cause gonna open doors chinese actors n actresses

china blocking movie playing makes sense way china spread love share culture especially pandemic fiasco movie opens doors chinese culture westerners

so support movie stop bashing unfounded selfish reasons",Positive

unfortunately movies ethnic discovery theme undercut clichés even older hollywood storyline one film historian dubbed racial adventure film simply call stupid american tourist film common since film plot follows western almost always white characters visit exotic foreign land  often purely exploitative purposes  proceed reveal ignorance native culture always demeaning colonizing indigenous peoples since former forced make buffoons latter must bear humiliation taken seriously

shangchi ethnic rediscovery film two chineseamericans san francisco learn one case relearn culture ancestors also racial adventure film essentially westerners travel china find midst culture clash white  case titular character immigrant  shangchi girlfriend otherwise fit role stupid american tourist unmistakably american accents annoying use slang pointless popculture references wisecracking sarcasm twist like kilmer thunderheart revert noble savage origins traveled ethnic place gone native

not incidentally theres one way shangchi legend ten rings differs dramatically black panther based nonwestern comic book sagas created white men black panther turns stereotypes black africans completely insideout giving us fantastic science fiction instead hackneyed jungle adventure shangchi usual kung pow hash orient presented ironically also way isnt terribly original

wowowowowow movie blew away love lot beginning end everything walked movie hyped silentscreaming mask walked car since walked movie happy much say

i love mcu lot things frequently lacking one good fight scenes always awesome action scenes specifically fight scenes usually pretty good great movies like civil war winter soldier part fight scenes american movies pale comparison asian cinema ip man raid redemption anything jackie chan

the fight scenes movie describe amazing martial arts thats fast clear filmed creative astonishing ways without hint shaky cam quick cuts stunningly beautiful backdrops phenomenal continuously focus fights instead cutting different scene  seconds like ive noticed mcu

this far best fighting mcu even close john wick series netflixs daredevil best weve seen america lately loved first major fight scene much worried would best one movie far early lol stupid sometimes theyre amazing

another frequent flaw mcu lack compelling villain nope villain full depth clear motivations sympathize cool charismatic intimidating formidable everything want villain

another area improvement musical scores dont stand think learned theyre good streak shows black widow great score fits perfectly movie individual scenesmoments amazing loki score definitely elevated movie feels unique new franchise

still much say need go faster one best maybe best story mcu especially way told flashbacks slow movie best scenes

i loved characters loved casting choices loved performances scenes dialogue gave goosebumps emotional moments hit callbacks hit isnt anything didnt work fires cylinders

lmao didnt mention cinematography would wait long mesmerizing lot throughout candy eyes

its also nice see wellwritten comedy jokes relevant scene characters feels organic opposed insert joke method weve seeing especially far home

whats opposite formulaic thats movie never knew expect next helps didnt watch single trailer ruin movies definitely doesnt feel like typical mcu movie unique tone feel character

continuing said headline thing get goosebumps start tearing emotional moment scene incredible especially action scenes dont know happens dont know happens people maybe partly cant risk blinking happened movie numerous times like coolest thing ive ever seen life hyperbole mannnnn

after endgame basically finished phase  happy satisfied mcu wasnt sure could ever recapture magic knew would watch everything would probably mostly awesome wasnt expecting toptier stuff lol stupid sometimes ecstatic notion obliterated top  mcu movie wow

all adore movie may wonder wouldnt give  raving super rare  watch thousands movies interstellar inception mad max fury road etc movies shouldnt even called movies rare favorite movies favorites favorites superhero movies ive given dark knight dark knight rises civil war

945,"endgame mcu welldeserved success  continue clear kevin feige want quit course unfortunately say film show avengers spectacle really convinced far thats hoping shangchi  score points spectacular action scenes inspired asian cinema watching movie im unfortunately anything enthusiastic shangchi great action rest

shaun best friend katy searching meaning life suddenly shauns father powerful mafia boss magical rings possession visits son reason shaun trained killer wanted different life sadly father cannot accept 

ill spoil small details opinion shangchi film really spoiled made like almost every typical superhero film

first lets get action received much critical acclaim yes choreographies really impressive beautiful look first two thirds something lot mcu movies dont well really appreciate action finale approaching action quickly subsides unfortunately needed big cgi battle festival big creatures apocalyptic events exactly already dealt critically civil war marvel keeps falling old superherocliché avengersfilms decision perfectly fine especially infinity war endgame stand alone films keep asking avengers spiderman doctor strange captain marvel

shangchi would worked much better finale personal battle shaun dad instead need gigantic demons cgi battles even green screen work always good opinion quickly looks artificial fake matter think matrix sequels fight scenes much impressive often used cgi needed lets watch asian martial arts films bruce lee jackie chan hardly ever computer trickery films shot moment rather watch john wickfilms want see spectacular handmade action shangchi unfortunately little offer apart action 

the story absolute runofthemill cliché stuff rather parodied many films classic outsider problems father still learn lot already good could easily girlfriend katy necessary sidekick knocks obvious jokes viewer get lost drama everything forced unnatural bored death marvel films particular supposed fun entertaining shangchi wants repeat black panther success shows superhero white case asian origin thats great important end mustnt forget film cannot judged solely basis intentions even black panther average many fans end could offer bit interesting story elements me

the mcu currently suffering trivial mass taste identity everything came endgame described one word safe shangchi also designed way many people possible enjoy film wants dark cool time also childfriendly funny

another problem way perfect protagonists new mcu works often solve problems within one film end movie example shangchi practically nothing improve tony stark peter parker fight work every film often reach goal end film makes characters exciting many ways opinion characters shangchi superficial problems may heartbreaking violent paper execution doesnt seem anything real typical movie feels like typical movie sounds like typical movie

the actors may reason didnt find acting performances really convincing interesting yes lead actor simu liu physically capable great stunts really appreciate comes acting well applies everyone cast except maybe tony leung chiu wai plays shauns father job well he´s business quite theres also surprise guest previous marvel movie wont name separately ive rarely seen pointless character movie character marvel kevin feige say heres fan service baby

director destin daniel cretton already made name film business certainly best intentions talented cameraman bill pope already worked matrix sequels sam raimis spiderman films end marvel disney seem much say want product suitable masses youre scorsese nolan easy get vision through

one last word composer joel p west wrote sometimes beautiful score asian influences action however whole thing quickly seems unimaginative
